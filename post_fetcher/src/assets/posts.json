            "selftext": "So I've bought and finished the EA at the Bard patch. Liked it, didn't love it for a few reasons, one of them being the music. It's very subjective and I can't really explain it, but it didn't sound \"Baldur's Gate\" to me (I'm one of those annoying people who value BG1 &amp; BG2 more than Divinity games, but I'm learning to keep an open mind).\n\nNow I'm doing a second run as a Paladin and I like it way better now. Maybe it's because the class is more straightforward, maybe it's because I've learned a lot on my first run, by the whole thing seems more pleasant (some fights in my first run were like pulling teeth, now I even managed to do Ethel without much issue - hated that fight the first time round). Also I think there's a lot subtle stuff added, like the animation when you talk to the tree-door basically showing you that you can just walk through it - thought it was a great addition).\n\nAnd on top of all that I really, really like the music now. I feel it's more in line with what I remember from BG1/BG2. Did something change? Did they add some new tracks, changed something in the arrangements between patches, or is that all in my mind?\n\nAnyway, loving the direction the game is heading and I'm getting more excited for the release now!",

On Medium graphics, you can get a steady fps locked at 30 fps. On Medium it'll bounce anywhere from 25(that's during some cutscenes) up to around 50. But I prefer to just lock it at 30 so I can pump some of the graphics up.\n\nBut aside from that, I noticed that the Larian launcher is still open after you've launched the game, and can easily close it down by pressing the \"Steam\" button on the SteamDeck and scrolling down to the \"Lari launcher\" and press X on the controller to close it. It doesn't do much for fps, but it does something. \n\nAnyways, all in all Baldurs gate 3 actually plays really nicely on the SteamDeck, I'm super excited for when they add controller support (proper controller support)",

I know there are bonuses for saving throws too but it's hard to tell what my guys want for optimal damage and accuracy. Like my rogue is level 3 thief and he doesn't really do anything. But it's not like I have armor that gives + dexterity or whatever to fix it. \n\nFor wizards, is int basically the only stat you want? on my first run my wizard was still barely hitting spells and not doing much damage but I had to be missing something. Also do different spells scale diff? Like does eldritch blast (force), magic missile (force), thunderous blast etc use different stats? Or is it just all int (Main stat for wizard?) If this is a lot of garbage I'm asking I'd happily watch a video or something explaining it, so far I've only found per class videos, and after one 20 minute paladin video I really don't wanna have to do that for every class lol!",

Meaning I enjoy the game but I don't really understand what's going on. I've been fumbling through without issue until I came upon the &gt;!Githyanki patrol !&lt;at level 4 &gt;!every member of the patrol is level 5!&lt;\n\nIt took me probably an hour or maybe more of reloading to clear this and I had to do some absolutely degenerate death juggle, alchemist's fire, grease, haste potion and Astarion double dash kiting to get it done. I couldn't get high ground advantage, for some reason every gith has 2-3 actions per turn instead of one, Astarion's ranged sneak attacks had a 100% chance of being parried (thank god it at least does chip damage). I had a horrible rate of misses but I've learned since the fight that \"miss\" is actually anything from resist to failure to penetrate armour to an actual miss, which is good because it means my party isn't drunk but bad because I have no idea if I was insufficiently prepared or if RNJesus just didn't accept my goat sacrifice.\n\nSo this gets me to the question(s): is this just lmao underleveled or am I cresting the point from low level simplicity into actual game mechanics? Do I have to find a few hours of youtube videos on what happens every level so I can be prepared for it? Can I watch D&amp;D videos or do they have to be BD3 specific? Was bard a bad choice for first class? Am I going to get 2 actions for all my guys when they ding 5? It was pretty obvious to me previous to this fight that there was a lot of stuff I didn't understand but I thought I'd be able to kind of learn-as-I-go and figure it out.

            "selftext": "I just wanted to create a thread about how much I appreciate that every time I play this game I find something new. \n\nI don't use guides or walkthroughs and rarely even read about others playing the game. I had my main playthrough, which was a Barbarian. I felt I did everything on the character so I ended up killing all the things, which accidentally I did through the playthrough anyway. I wasn't trying to be a murder hobo, just Barbarian roar. Killed the druids and the tieflings, all the goblins, all the fungoids and duergar. Every NPC that I knew of was in the game. \n\nThen playing the game on a new character I somehow missed the entire gnoll section, not sure how. So I go back to my Barbarian and kill all the gnolls and discover that Gith fight on the bridge (which was probably the hardest fight in the game). \n\nThen on a new character, I finally found that druid Haldin or whatever. Somehow I missed just a tiny bit of exploration in the Goblin Dens and never found him. I just assumed he was not in the beta. So I go back to my Barbarian and I free him and a few other niche exploration areas until I'm confident I explored all the maps in their entirety. \n\nSo I make a new character and I kill that mage companion and there's this whole cutscene and quest involving him and his death and that surprised me. \n\nThen I started playing with mods and custom parties, and I rush and free Haldin before even entering the village and I start having a dream where I finally meet the girl you create at the character select and I'm like what in the world? Finding out she's probably the parasite is kind of neat, but then I get a parasite power too and I'm completely shocked. I was able to test out the Warlock, Clerics, Sorcerers and Druids parasite power (My custom party comp), can't wait to try other class ones. \n\nSomehow by killing everyone my Barbarian never achieved that cutscene and never attained the parasite power. \n\nHere I am a dozen characters later and I'm still finding things and interactions I didn't find on my Barbarian. \n\nI hope the rest of the game is this good, because quite honestly I've never seen time vanish as fast as I do with this game in probably a decade. I feel like I'm playing five minutes and twelve hours has gone by.\n\nI also installed this mod that has a lot of races and they added in some FFXIV races, which is awesome but they left out miqote. My disappointment cannot be expressed with words that miqote is not the first FFXIV race that is added to Baldur's gate.",

One pickpocketing one I found was simply be a bard, I leveled them to 5(for the +6 in all skills proficient, or +3 on all others), guidance(for +1-4), bestow curse wisdom(for disadvantage for them catching you). Haven't done anything for the druid grove or goblin camp, so including the shops there, the underdark, etc(including Ethel as I didn't hit that trigger). So, with all that, you get a 12-15 sleight of hand base(depending on guidance) and the dc is lower due to the curse, although that's limited based on spell slots on your party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, have +1 everything for all companions, really good enchantment stuff, resistance potions, hillgiant potions, and 80K gold for 1 hour worth of stuff. Would expected the DC to increase after each time, but no. If you do the pickpocketing in turnbased mode, after you're done, just stand up, leave, and 10 seconds later either they'll look around for you or get a guard to look for you. As long as you're not in the area, just wait 20 seconds(or more likely, just go to the next merchant) or you'll need to pass a decently difficult deception check.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso it's really easy to get to the pickpocketing position to start with. Minor illusion, darkness, fog, etc, and am semi-consistently passing dc20-25 checks with all the bonuses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr, with bards, you can get anything free and get a overexcessive amount of gold/potions/gear/etc as at level 5, you can get your sleight of hand to 12+ as a base.",

I went for an option to connect with his mind, since I've never done that. It worked, and after that, I had to make a Wisdown Save to break the connection. I rolled a natural 1 and failed,  and I thought it was awesome, since it would result in something I never saw.\n\nAs the game is still very laggy, this sequence happened: Shadowheart lost all her HP, the Mind Flayer got up healed, combat started, all of the party went 0 hit points, my character when 1 HP, then 0 and then the game over screen.\n\nThere was no actual combat, my characters just died.\n\n--\n\nMy opinion: We shouldn't have to load the previous save because of a dice result. If I fail in an ability check, I want to face those consequences in game. It's not fair to have a game over because of NRG. Because this means, after all, that the dice rolled didn't mean anything. If you fail a check, and have to load the game and do it again, why bother having the roll at all? Makes no sense.\n\nA natural one, or any failed check should result in failing your attempt and having to deal with that. In that scenario, having to fight the mind flayer while shadowheart is down, for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelated to that, on my first playthrough I found something similar. A failed check during the druids cave scene, with the kid, that resulted in &gt;!her dying automatically . !&lt;\n\nThis feels unfare, it feels a bad DM that want to punish you for having a bad roll. I think when you fail a check like that, the result should be a combat. You try to talk your way out, didn't work out, you'll not let this happen, roll iniciative.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n--- EDIT\n\n Yeah, as someone replied, it probably was the AOE from the mind flayer that instant kill all of my party and I couldn't see because of the laggy.

            "selftext": "Hi all!  \nSo after my post about 1-2 days ago about if the EA was worth a shot or not. I have to say.   \nIt really was! Never really played any RPG with D&amp;D mechanics before. Not even Diablo. Closest i can get is Dragon Age and The Witcher 3. Skyrim too i suppose.  \n But this game has it all. Good dialogue, good story, a general \"red thread\" throughout the game and gameplay. Interesting companions. And your choices feel like they actually matter and what you pick to say in conversations.  \n\n\nHowever, my one wish for games such as Baldur's gate 3, is the flexibility of the camera.  \nI sort of stayed away from D&amp;D games and Diablo for this reason. The \"view over the top\" and   \n\"half ass over the shoulder view\" for these games has always kind of bothered me.  \n They feel ***very*** ***limiting*** so to speak. I can of course deal with it, but there it is.  \n\n\nFor example: If i was to try to take screenshots of my character and the area they are in....You can only do so in this very tiny circled area around you. You cant really have the same freedom with the camera as in say God Of War where you can really span the camera around. Hell you can only really turn the camera downwards to have this \"half ass\" over the shoulder view like i mentioned in Baldur's gate.  \n Is your character going up a hill and you want to have the camera close? Enjoy watching the dirt on the ground until you eiter span the camera to the over the top view or get to even ground. Because the camera cannot look up toward the hill.  \n\n\nI know D&amp;D games are supposed to have the Top view camera, since that's just what it has always been.   \nBut have the developers mentioned anything about adjusting this, what i would call it. \"Limitation\" on the camera. And what are your thoughts on the matter? Am i the only one to feel this way about the camera?\n\nSorry if the text was long and if it sounds like a rant (it really isn't), but i find it hard to express what i truly mean in short texts. Have a good one though folks!",

            "selftext": "I'd like to preface this by saying I'm extremely excited for BG3, and I can't wait until full release. I also know that Larian has expressed that custom characters will have their stories be more intertwined with the world from their backgrounds and class, but it has been left a bit vague.\n\nMy wish, as evidence from the title, is that I hope our custom characters don't suddenly appear. Sure, the world can react to what we've selected, but that doesn't mean we existed before we were taken by the Mind Flayers. We can make choices like what bar or tavern we like to hang out at in Baldur's Gate. We can even talk to other characters about what our history is or who we were in Baldur's Gate. So by that logic, we should exist, and someone should recognize and know our custom character back in the city.\n\nAs the obvious comparison, a custom character was quite weak story-wise comparatively to an origin character in DOS2 because there was less story to go with it. However, it wasn't just that there was less dialogue. It was that the origin characters existed before they ever ended up on the Merryweather. They had lives and goals before meeting any other character. You could also take a look at the Dragon Age games where Origins had characters that you could meet again after the opening. Or Inquisition, where there'd be some kind of written version of, \"Yes, you existed before.\" Even the original Baldur's Gate games had a companion that knew you, Imoen, before you ever set off on the campaign.\n\nIt doesn't have to be far reaching, and it doesn't have to be some super important name in the story. It can be the tavern keeper, a guard on patrol, or doctor that the character often visits. Or is it that every custom character is just the loneliest existence until they get the tadpole? All I'm saying is I hope custom characters exist before they were captured and sent to the Nautiloid.",

For example, I really like Lae'zel and Karlach and want to have both of them in the party. If I'll play as Karlach, evil Lae'zel will most likely get angry and leave the party. But if I pick Lae'zel as a good player character and run a 'good' playthrough, everyone will be happy (well, unless we absolutely *must* do something evil as a part of Origin PC's personal quest or will be restricted with specific evil dialogue choices). So technically I will have one more good character with cool backstory in my party instead of generic good Tav. Is it possible?\n\nI know that the game is not out yet, but how much the worldview of Origin companions is locked story-wise, in your opinion?",

            "selftext": "I'll snag a screenshot, in the next few days, but I made a demifemme (she/they) half-drow bard: Wynafrit Cordleif, of the College of Lore.\n\nReasons why I say I might be over-roleplaying?\n\n(A) I imagine that Wynafrit's lover (who went missing prior to the illithid attack on Baldur's Gate) was killed by Cazador Szarr\u2014the vampire master of Astarion. Whether the vampirespawn assisted in kidnapping Wynnie's partner or not, unsure of that part, yet (though at minimum, Astarion may somewhat remember his master's last \"meal\"). So it makes the mind flayer parasite dreams of Cordleif's late lover even creepier, in that context.\n\n(B) As a nod to my favorite old mofo in D&amp;D, from while I was growing up, I kinda want Cordleif to half-joke/speculate that their father they never met was the drow mercenary Jarlaxle himself. No solid proof, but \"dear old mum\" supposedly swore that Wynnie was their lovechild. At best, though, the demifemme bastard can tell a couple interesting tales on One-Eyed Jax, and boast that they're likely related to the drow who practically runs the freeport of Luskan.\n\nEdit: (C) The name \"Cordleif\" is a play off of the cords of the lyre that Wynafrit uses, with the suffix -leif meaning love. The half-drow also wound up developing ginger hair, during adolescence, and her mother liked to claim that the goddess Sune smiled upon Wynnie (although the bard also managed to grow a rather dashing beard and moustache, leading to other jokes of a forgotten dwarven relative). The bard plays it all up to at least put on a show, but ultimately has no real vested interest in deities; having never felt any divine calling, the gods are hardly any different in Wynafrit's eyes from the supposed estranged father that at least gives them plenty of stories to work with.\n\nI have a few other characters I've been messing with, in Early Access, but it's nice to have an enby option, as someone who also identifies as demifemme.",

I'll write the problems and how \u0131 solved them in this post with \"Keywords\" so when people search for them, it could be listed on Google search results. I lost days because of that little problems, that's why \u0131'm writing this.\n\nIf \u0131 have new problems and solutions, \u0131'll update this post. I hope this will be useful.\n\n**Baldur's Gate 3 launcher won't launch, BG3 not launching;**\n\nDefinition: You downloaded the game from steam and clicked \"Play Button\". Sometimes, Steam is assuming game as it started and counting playtime but actually it is not started. Sometimes, after click Play button, game icon starts bouncing for 2-3 minutes, nothing happens, no crash  report etc. and Steam closes the game. \n\nSolution: Change the language of Steam to be the same as the language of the launcher.\n\n**Download Baldur's Gate 3 to an External HDD for Macs;**\n\nMy Experience: I Tried this, \u0131 don't know it works or not. Because, after you download the game, it really takes so long time to \"Steam checking game files\". After Steam completed that, your Macbook will starts it's own file checking process. I completed all of them but couldn't start game from External HDD. \n\n**Playing Baldur's Gate 3 with external monitor on your M1 Macbook;**\n\nMy Experience: Game always starts on Mac's own screen, \u0131 couldn't change it to launch on an external monitor. You can change it after game starts. My ext. LG monitor is showing as \" Macbook monitor\" under video setting. Actually there are to screens have same name, one of the should be the ext. monitor. You can change it an use it. \n\n**Baldur's Gate 3 crashed when change screen resolution or refresh rate;**\n\nMy Experience: Sometimes when \u0131 change the screen resolution, game crashes. It happens when \u0131 change it to my usual resolution. The solution is changing it to another resolution like 1600x900 and again change it to your actual resolution like 1920x1080. Because every time you closed the game, it resets video settings while you are playing whit external monitor.   \n\nAlso \u0131f your HDMI cable is not supporting the resolution and refresh rate you are trying to apply, the game will be crash. I solved it by buying a new HDMI cable. \n\nMy system summary: Apple M1 Macbook air, Ram: 8 GB, CPU: 8 core, Storage: 256 GB\n\nI'm not native English speaking person, just trying to help people having problems and can't reach solutions easily like me.

Aside from being a delightful conversationalist he claims that he can remove the mindflayer tadpole from the party, all for the low bargain of our immortal souls. This is suspicious for a plethora of reasons, but my main question is who does Raphael serve. Raphael is only a Cambion (half mortal, half devil) and is low on the pyramid that is the infernal hierarchy. If a powerful Hag like Auntie Ethel and the Rogue Illithid Omeleum can't help us, then how is a random Cambion going to help us? The answer? It is his boss who will help us, my guess one of the Archdevils of Hell. Raphael is merely their representative to initiate contact, gauge the reaction of the party, make the initial offer and report back to base on how the offer was received. So who is Raphael working for and why are they interested in the party?",

            "selftext": "I have been compiling info on the PC/PS5 Collector's Edition and thought others may find this interesting:\n\n- PC CE was announced on Dec 8 2022 @ the Game Awards and advertised as limited to 25,000 units. \n\n- 6000 were sold in the first 2 days, 7800 in 4 days, 9000 in 8 days and 9148 in 13 days. See this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/zt2q8i/collectors_edition_do_you_think_the_stock_will/\n\n- Orders previously made through the website (https://ce.baldursgate3.game/) were handled differently than the current Merch store orders (https://merch.larian.com/). The Merch store invoice #s include ALL merch available so it is impossible for us to figure out how many PC/PS5 CEs have sold now. \n\n- PS5 CE was announced on Feb 23, 2023. My first order for a PS5 CE was on Feb 24 and the order# was in the 10,400's and TC has order# 13104. With the above info, we know that there has been over 2700 orders between Feb 24 and March 9 on the Merch store. We have no way to know how many of those were PC/PS5 CEs, other merchandise or multiple units per order. \n\n- Orders previously made on website were not charged sales tax where the Merch store now factors it in. My PS5 CE was $27 CDN more than my PC CE order because of this. \n\n- Your order/invoice # has no correlation to what CE # you receive. If you order now or the last day available, the CE# you receive will be random. See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/zm1te0/important_your_order_has_zero_correlation_with/\n\n- 3 extra MTG booster packs were to be sent to the first 15k PC CE preorders. Larian has reserved some of that stock for the PS5 CE orders as well. I do not have any clarification on the website where it mentions 3 packs per CE in one spot and 1 pack per CE in another, only that both versions have extra MTG booster packs allocated to the first X amount of orders. \n\n- The PC CE is still limited to 25,000. Larian has not announced how many PS5 CEs they will be making, nor for the inevitable Xbox CE. I am going to assume 10,000 or 15,000 (5k or 7500 for each console) with how the sales of the PC CE tapered off quickly\n\n- If you contact Larian Support, you can change your PC CE order to a PS5 CE\n\n- The game and the CE content are separate codes in the box.\n\n- Larian will be shipping the CEs out for arrival on/before Aug 28th for the 72 hours early access. The actual delivery date will vary by location/weather/etc.\n\n- There is no upgrade or discount when purchasing the CE if you already have Early Access on PC.  If you have purchased an EA PC key, you will be upgraded to the Digital Deluxe version for free.\n\n- When your order a PC/PS5 CE, you need near immediate payment now. If you start a CE order on the Merch store, and cancel payment, your order will change to \"Awaiting Payment\" for about 5 days then it will be cancelled if you do not complete the transaction through their PayPal options. \n\nFeel free to add a thing I may have missed or offer any corrections that may be needed. \n\nThanks all!",

Has Larian talked more about this feature since then? It seems insanely ambitious when you consider the amount of dialogue and all the voice choices (both custom and origin).",

Of course I also can't talk about this fight without mentioning how you can remove the skele's weapons before they wake. \n\nI also love fights where the goal isn't specifically to beat all enemies.

            "selftext": "I haven't done a playthrough of the EA in a while, and I was thinking of doing a consumables only run. I'm still trying to iron out what the exact rules would be and how I ought to build my party to start.\n\n1. All damage and healing must be achieved using: special ammunition, grenades, potions, barrels, or spell scrolls. Resting is allowed, as it consumes food.\n2. Items may be equipped, but only their passive benefits may be utilized. Ranged weapons are permitted, but only for the use of special ammunition. I'm not gonna allow thrown weapons (or non-grenade/potion/barrel objects), as picking them back up presents a slippery slope.\n3. The only spells allowed in combat are spell scrolls. Outside of combat, the only non-scroll spells allowed are guidance, goodberry, and enhance ability (for obvious reasons). No racial spells allowed.\n\nI'm not seeing any good reason to go with having any of the origin characters in my party, other than having one slot I don't fill with a custom character just to keep some versatility. The spellcasters are pretty worthless, and neither Astarion or Laezel are a good build for this.\n\nI don't think any of the cleric domain benefits justify filling a slot with one. Sorcerers and wizards have all their abilities centered around their spellcasting, so neither of them are of any use. The only benefits druids would bring are better tanking in wild shape, but they wouldn't even be allowed to attack while in animal form. I see no tangible benefit to a warlock in this challenge.\n\nBoth paladins and barbarians are largely focused around being melee attackers, but they both have usable abilities that are at least worth considering for their utility. I don't believe a rogue's sneak attack is useable in conjunction with special ammunition, but as a character with expertise in sleight of hand will be required, they are at least somewhat relevant.\n\nRangers and fighters both have access to the archery fighting style, and the subclasses of both at least have some abilities that it's possible to make use of. Bardic inspiration is still allowed by the challenge, and they're a marginally more versatile option than the rogue to be the person with expertise.",

Additionally, with the \"sell swords\" we could then go into the mirror thing and completely respec them as if we were essentially creating a brand new 2nd character each.  \n\n\nDoes anyone know if that's something we'll be able to do in BG3? Essentially \"creating\" 2 characters each (for a total of 4 in our party) or will we only be able to \"create\" 1 character each and then be stuck to either recruiting A.) the fleshed out NPCs or B.) generic NPCs (that we cannot customize)?  \n\n\nSorry if that doesn't make sense or I'm butchering any of the comparisons.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nI'm thinking on buying Baldur's Gate 3, but I'm a bit unsure after reading a few negative reviews.\n\nI love RPG and I enjoy the DND setting overall. I also absolutely love DOS2, it's one of my favorite games ever (tied with The Witcher 3).\n\nHowever, I thoroughly dislike d20 mechanic\n\nA rant about d20 follows:\n\n I feel like pretty much every other die system out there is superior to d20, if nothing else due to the way that in d20 systems your character's skills are far less important than the roll of the dice: the roll of the dice accounts for 1 to 20, whereas your character skills float in the mid single digits for most games, and the die makes for 5% failure rate (sometimes critical failure) and 5% critical rate **no matter what**.\n\nthe d20 itself is sexy, I'll give it that, but it's way too much RNG for me; it's good to have randomness, but the choices should matter **more** than the randomness, not less\n\nI haven't looked at the systems for Baldur's Gate 3 yet, so my question is mainly: is the d20 system in the game very much like D&amp;D's tabletop system? Are skills less impactful than the RNG?",

            "selftext": "I recently started playing BG3. I find many aspects confusing, and little guidance given by the developers.\n\nFor example, what is the difference between cantrips, spells, and abilities? How many spells can you cast before a rest, and of what levels? Also, why are the spells almost identical in the beginning with different classes?\n\nThere is absolutely no guidance on creating and managing a character for someone who is not already an experienced D&amp;D player in terms of spellcasters.\n\nAnother thing that I do not understand is camp and camp supplies. I have only long rested once, and it sends you to a completely random spot, nowhere near where you originally were. It told me that I did not have enough camp supplies, so I would not replenish short rests. This doesn't make sense, as I constantly have to \"send supplies to camp\" to prevent being encumbered.\n\nThe last thing that is just an annoyance is the movement controls. Often I am trying to pick up an item, and my characters (all four of them) climb up on some table or some box to reach an item clear across the table. I try to pick up another item right next to that and they all walk over the box, over the table, and stand on the table to pick the item up. Completely ruins any immersion, not to mention the inconvenience when you are trying to \"sneak\".\n\nDoes Larian Studios have any intention on implementing an introduction to these more complex systems for new players? As a new player I really want to enjoy this game, but these few things are completely holding me back. At the least, I would like to understand my character creation and potential future paths.\n\nThanks for any comments \ud83d\ude0a",

            "selftext": "I found an old Usenet post I made in comp.says.ibm.pc.games.rpg that spoke of BG3 back in 2001. (Yes I am super old).\n\n\u201c\nI have played every bioware/interplay one and loved them all. Was really\nlooking forward to POR, but was disappointed with the gameplay and bugs, so\nI returned it. Arcanum was ok, but it didn't really have the sparkle of BG2.\nIs there any BG-like game in the foreseeable future?\n\nIt seems like with the success of BG, there would be a plethora of\nknockoffs, but I've yet to see any worth the cardboard they are boxed in. I\nguess I got a little spoiled with getting BG, PT, IWD, BG2 and TOB all in a\nprogression. It was nice to always have another variant on the horizon. I\nreally like the bg-style of being able to pause time and stack orders\ncoupled with the epic story line and ability to customize the players. I\nalso really liked Jagged Alliance, but a squad based tactical rpg in a\nfantasy setting that progresses through an epic adventure is what I'm really\nlooking for. Hey, at least I know what I want!\n\nI understand NWN is coming out, and I'm looking forward to checking it out,\nbut I fear it looks a little too \"3D\" for my taste. I really hope I'm wrong\nabout that. Also, I'm not that jazzed about the concept of online\nmultiplayer play. That's a nice idea in concept, but in reality, I find that\nI want to immerse myself in the story at my own pace and at my own time of\nday. I prefer to leave online play for golf and Red Alert2. If I want to\nhave someone to adventure with, I want it to be a NPC Dwarf with a bizarre\nback story, several side quests and colorful dialog. Not some 13 year old\nwarezdood who would disconnect after I didn't split my 35 gp exactly in half\nwith him.\n\nI really like the way the bg-type games look and play... These games were\nsuccessful. Why is this formula being left for dead?\nWhy does everything have to be 3d anyway? The characters in BG2 looked a\nmillion times better than the ones in POR IMO. Yet it seems that everyone is\nabandoning 2d. Shame.\n\nI was initially intrigued with Commandos 2. This game LOOKS great. (Why cant\nthere be a rpg with this type of graphic engine?), but its too tactical,\nslow and unforgiving for my taste. Not to mention that I cant cast magic\nmissile on the Nazis. (how cool would that be).\n\nI cannot play 1st person because it gives me motion sickness or I would be\nenjoying Wiz8 right now. : ( It would have been great had sir-tech made a\nrpg similar to how Jagged Alliance looked.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is... I WANT BG3! : )\n\nThanks for reading my desperate rant.\u201d\n\nNow that my prayers have finally been answered, let\u2019s just say I have been waiting a long time for this and am so eagerly awaiting its full release.",

            "selftext": "First of all, let's check all the companions who are confirmed and their classes:\n\nShadowheart - Cleric\n\nGale - Mage\n\nAstarion - Rogue \n\nWyll - warlock \n\nLaezal - Fighter \n\nJaheira - druid (or druid/ fighter)\n\nMinsc - Ranger\n\nKarlach - barbarian\n\nAnd... if they did not change their mind: \n\nHelia - Bard\n\n----\n\n-Now, why can Minthara be a companion?\n\nWe need someone who replaces Wyll if we are evil, don't we?\n\nWe have seen new screenshots and she appeared in one of them. \n\nShe is romancable and the affair seems to have more to offer \n\nShe is paladin now so that we do not have 2 Cleric (shadowheart) in the team\n\nBesides, there are just 3 classes without companion: monk, sorcerer and... paladin\n\nThe game requirements soared.. in too much space she may be included as a companion \n\nShe has a deeper background than the other 2 goblin leaders. You can read her mind while sleeping and find some saddening experiences. Therefore, she is not a flat character.  She is a round one! \n\n\n----------\u2010----\n\n- some arguments against my reasoning:\n\nShe is reached too late. She is a key character in order to advance act 1, so we cannot recruit her as sooner as other characters.\n\nWhen would be she available as a companion? As soon as we talk to her? Not at all, since we must invade the druid grove. Even so we can let her down if druids archieve to seal the refuge. After the romance? Maybe, but if we read her mind, she will try to kill us in our sleep without remorse at all. If we are not that gossip, she claims she must leave, so when can we recruit her?\n\nPaladin doesn't suit her.. what kind of paladin would she be? Oathbreaker? Can she retake her previous oath? Maybe she follows the oath of Vengeance...\n\nMaybe, in the end she is just a follower, but I find it strange that a bellicose woman would be glad to stay at camp (Halsin stays there since he may sacrifice for us...).\n\nFinally, we have too many companions. She has not been kidnapped, so she cannot be eligible as an origin character.\n\n------\n\nIn conclusion, we do not have many clues, but I perceive so many drawbacks, which makes it hard for her to be a companion, but Larian is too imaginative and can accomplish it. Anyway, she is likely to have an important role if we ally with her.\n\nThanks for reading me. Hope you enjoyed my thoughts.",

            "title": "ChatGPT - What's the most versatile class?",
            "selftext": "Context! My experience with DOS2 tells me that I'm only going to complete BG3 once - work and family takes a lot of time! So I'm theorycrafting a build that will cover as much of the game in one go! For classes I was comparing Bard versus Rogue. So I asked ChatGPT:\n\nMe:\n\nWhat's the most versatile class in D&amp;D 5E?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nIn Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition, each class has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and their versatility can depend on how they are built and played. However, some classes are more versatile than others in terms of their ability to adapt to different situations and roles.\n\nBased on my experience and observations, I would say that the most versatile class in D&amp;D 5e is the Bard. Bards are proficient in a wide range of skills and have access to a diverse array of spells that can be used for support, healing, damage dealing, and control. Additionally, bards can choose their Bardic College, which grants them unique abilities and focuses their strengths in specific areas such as combat, magic, or social interactions.\n\nBards can be built to excel in many roles, such as a spellcaster, a support character, a melee combatant, or a skill monkey. Finally, Bards have an excellent feature called \"Magical Secrets,\" which allows them to learn spells from any class, further expanding their already vast spellcasting options.\n\nThat being said, all classes can be versatile depending on how they are built and played, and ultimately, the most versatile class depends on the player's preferences and playstyle.\n\nMe:\n\nWhat about the Rogue?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nRogues are also versatile in their own way. They have a wide range of skills and are excellent at sneaking, stealing, and dealing damage with their sneak attack ability. They also have access to a unique subclass called Arcane Trickster, which grants them limited spellcasting abilities.\n\nHowever, compared to the Bard, the Rogue is more specialized in specific areas. While they excel in stealth and damage dealing, they may not be as effective in situations that require magic or support abilities. Additionally, their reliance on sneak attack can limit their effectiveness if they are unable to use it in combat.\n\nThat being said, Rogues can still be versatile depending on how they are built and played. They can also choose different subclasses, such as the Mastermind or Inquisitive, to gain unique abilities that complement their playstyle. Ultimately, the Rogue's versatility depends on the player's preferences and how they choose to build and play their character.\n\nMe:\n\nWould a rogues expertise outperform a bards charisma in dialogue skill checks?\n\nChatGPT:\n\nNot necessarily. Both Rogues and Bards have access to the Expertise feature, which allows them to double their proficiency bonus in certain skills, including Persuasion. However, while Rogues may have a higher proficiency bonus in general, Bards have access to additional features that can enhance their Persuasion checks.\n\nBards have a feature called \"Jack of All Trades,\" which adds half of their proficiency bonus to ability checks they are not proficient in. Additionally, they can use their Bardic Inspiration feature to add an additional d6 to their ability check roll, which can be increased as they level up. Finally, Bards have access to spells such as Charm Person or Suggestion, which can give them an advantage in Persuasion checks.\n\nSo, while Rogues may have higher proficiency bonuses in general, Bards have additional features and spells that can give them an edge in Persuasion checks. Ultimately, the outcome of a Persuasion check depends on many factors, including the DM's discretion, the target's disposition, and the circumstances of the situation.\n\nMe:\n\nThanks!\n(Edit. Gotta be kind to our AI overloards)",

(Assuming there is even a choice that is) \n\nIf you\u2019ve played DOS2, then you definitely know the experience of what I\u2019m referring to where the rewards were randomly generated, but you couldn\u2019t compare them to what you currently had equipped.

In Early Access you\u2019ll be able to play as a Cleric, Fighter, Ranger,  Rogue, Warlock or Wizard.*\n\n**Does that include paths, subclasses, etc?**\n\n*NickP: Yep.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever Larian quickly walked this claim back on the [June 17, 2020 interview with Cohh Carnage](https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1273342584472166401?s=20&amp;t=Q6YfSr6JM--0wwRn2LiW9Q), where at the 1:50 mark Swen says that they may NOT get all PHB subclasses but should  get a sizable portion.\n\nI'm afraid that when the game finally releases this community is going to go up in flames about missing subclasses due to how  widespread these \"alll PHB subclasses\" assumptions are. I'd love to see all the PHB  subclasses, but doubt it's going to happen. And if Larian were to cut some PHB subclasses (cleric and wizard have a ton) in place of adding some more non-PHB subclasses for those that are lacking (like they did with Oathbreaker Paladin) then I'd be all for it. Though I anticipate some very vocal members of the community will see it differently.\n\nEven if Larian were to make a statement clarifying that all PHB subclasses may not be in the game, people will take that as them walking back claims that Larian has been making all along due to how widespread these \"all PHB subclasses\" assumptions are.",

But from what I can tell, her look is completely different now in almost every way... Is there no way to revert it for my own playthrough? Will someone just make a mod I can use? Or maybe I will be able to take her to a salon and get a haircut after I recruit her or something? lol I'm just not sure I wanna pay for a full game if the character I want it for doesn't appeal to me anymore... Also I played Baldur's Gate 2 with a friend for several hours and couldn't even get out of the tutorial dungeon before uninstalling... It was too obtuse and confusing. But the change to being turn based gives me hope that I can keep up better now, and also I would assume there are a lot more tutorials and stuff. Does Baldur's Gate 3 appeal to fans not of the older games, but of fans of other turn based strategy RPGs? Like Midnight Suns or Fire Emblem? I should also mention that I've never played Dungeons and Dragons proper because I'm not the most social person. That's probably part of why BG2 was so rough for me. Idk I just really want to be able to play and enjoy this game but I don't know based on all of these things. I will be waiting for the full release later this year regardless",

Notable differences I've seen are added abilities on top of the pre-existing totems.\nI cant name Any at the top of My head right now, but I remember seeing the bear totem getting its usual ability of resistances to everything other than psycic, but then i remember seeing an 'active ability' on top of that.\n\nIm simply wondering why that is, exactly?\nSince i already know quite a bit of the 5e abilities, spells and such, it's Strange to see these New features being added.\n\nDo they think the subclasses needed more? Is it a balancing Thing because of the tabletop game is being put i to virtual play?\n\nI can see some abilities being out right redundant, since telepathy doesnt really work as well once you got discord among other Things.\n\nIt's really interesting either way.",

But, Jump doesn't avoid attacks that way, I just died trying it, and shove can't knock people prone, only away.

I'm also reading about how easy it is to get advantage on all your attacks by flanking in melee, but that doesn't work either. I can completely surround someone in party members, and I don't get advantage. Has this also been changed?\n\nI guess what I'm really asking is where all the cheese is at.

To no one\u2019s surprise everyone recommended it. I have not enjoyed a video game this much in a very very long time. This game is early access but feels on par with a lot of title published by bigger studios. I am not concerned with min maxing, and I am just going through and making choices that feel right in the moment. With this game being basically 5e, it also hits that itch I have had for a long time. \n\nI can enjoy D&amp;D without people. My heart and soul feel so profoundly great full for the experience so far and I can not give this game high enough of a praise. I am 4 hours into the game and I feel like I barely got anything explored which is a good thing. The story they are setting up feels like it will be epic and the way the handle the talking is such a good method of doing conversation. While I did experience some bugs, they are so minor so far that I just keep going without it feeling like it ruins the experience. I have died many times because I am used to being able to run in and kill everything in every other game, but I am learning that this game requires planning and actual thought into combat. I have also learned that trapped chests are not just to add fluff to the conversation but there are actually trapped chests which can and have killed me. \n\nMaybe later in the game it will feel easier but I enjoy the challenge this game is providing. The fact that I can leap up a cliff due to a racial ability and hulk smash while keep my party alive with cleric abilities just feels right.",

Like he's talking himself up or even making up tales to male himself seem like a Good Person. Compare that to Shadowheart and it feels more like Shadowheart is a good person at heart and Gale is manipulation you to *think* he's this caring and good hearted person.\n\nThen we have Raphael's poem and Gale thinking you can outwit Raphael. My take is Gale is the mouse and is thinking he can outwit the Cat, and misses seeing the paw come down on him. Just feels like blind arrogance on the man's part.\n\nSpoilers since I've read this from other players, but haven't encountered it yet in my playthrough. \n\nSo then we come to Gale needing magical artifacts to avoid going BOOM and getting upset if you don't give him any. Going so far as to sell his soul to Raphael. No idea if it was for a permanent solution or a temporary one. First off we didn't ask or tell him to make that deal with Raphael, so not sure if the consequences are ours to bear. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong and Gale is a Good Align person.

            "selftext": "I went with Lae'zel to the gith patrol and we decided to tell her kin the truth about our condition, so they attacked. All seemed well, she was happy that we survived and said that the other githyanki were not following her queen's orders, whatever. Then, I hosted the tiefling party and spent the night with Lae'zel, not doing anything else to piss her off and kept our affinity in the Medium position.\n\nThen I headed to the Underdark, had the spectator fight, and then made camp. She had the ! icon overhead and the dialogue options I had for her were \"what was that back there?\" and \"show me some respect next time or we're done.\" The conversation was about some other githyanki we had allegedly spoke to, but I did not have any interaction with any gith since the patrol. We had even rested since the patrol and this dialogue tree had not come up yet.\n\nDid the game accidentally flag something as completed that shouldn't have been? There was no indicator that something had happened or that Lae'zel had \"shown me disrespect\" in any interaction we had. In fact, I'm not sure I spoke to ANYBODY between now and then. Either way, wondering if anyone here knows what I might have missed or misunderstood so I can fill in the blanks here. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: Included a picture of the initial conversation to provide more context. Nothing had seemed hostile between me and her at the gith patrol, so I don't really know why my character was supposed to be so upset at her. The enemies initiated combat in the first place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n3um2pwqjra1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7075bea8d2b99866158dcec65463cb1573e2ee15",

Real-time with pause is pretty wonky, unlike the originals and Pillars of Eternity which implemented it real well.\n\n3. Multiplayer.

Even the healthbars look like they were copied from DoS.\n\n5.

Let's share with one another builds and classes that we find interesting to play, and I'll start first.\n\nRace: Tiefling  \nSubrace: Mephistopheles Tiefling  \nClass: Sorcerer (FIRE)  \nSubclass: Wild Magic\n\nLVL 1\n\nSTR: 8  \nDEX: 15  \nCON: 14  \nINT: 8  \nWIS: 10  \nCHA: 15\n\nLVL 2. Metamagic options (Twinned Spell, Distant Spell)  \nSpells: Chromatic Orb, Burning Hands\n\nLVL 3. Metamagic options (Heightened Spell)  \nSpells: Scorching Ray\n\nLVL 4. Lightly Armored + 1 DEX  \nSpells: Misty Step or Mirror Image\n\nLVL 5. Spells: Fireball\n\nIn the game, we are a regular sorcerer without armor who throws fire spells and uses scrolls to increase magical armor to level 4. Firstly, we want to get to the Druid Grove as quickly as possible and steal Volo's Eye to increase our charisma to 16. Then, we go to the underground laboratory to obtain the Circlet of Fire in the Dead Village Ruins. After that, we head to the goblin camp to obtain Minthara's Spidersilk Armor.\n\nIn the endgame, at level five, the Tieflings of Mephistopheles gain a spell called Legacy of Cania: Flame Blade. Before the battle, we summon the blade and take it to our left hand. The spellcasting ability for the summoned blade is Charisma, and the chance to hit will be high. In our main hand, we can have a weapon of our choice that we are proficient with, such as a dagger. In combat, the first thing we do is cast a fire spell, such as Fireball or Burning Hands, which will give us an additional bonus action thanks to our Circlet of Fire. This will give us two bonus actions to use with our blade. With Wild Magic options, the outcome can be unpredictable. The worst-case scenario is that we could end up igniting everything in the area, but Tieflings have resistance to fire, so as long as we position ourselves correctly, nothing bad will happen, and we can use the wild magic bonuses to enchant our weapons, teleport, swap places with opponents, and more.\n\nMinthara's Spidersilk Armor will help us to avoid losing concentration on the Flame Blade since it has Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws. Also, consider obtaining the Ring of Fire and Gloves of Flint and Steel to increase our fire damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucrvvh29ousa1.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c7d5928cdd164cf16dbc03e577444b2e999cc6e0",

This is the only fight they'll ever have, so of course they're just going to cast every spell they have. Getting hold person'd over and over again is fun gameplay.\n\nYou do have to care about spell slots, so you wait to use them until they're absolutely necessary. This results in combats where you don't use a single ability. Sure you can win, but was it a fun fight? Not really. Oh, and your limited resource abilities can miss. So not only did you waste your turn, you wasted a spell slot. This does not feel good.\n\nYes, you can long rest pretty much anywhere. But it's just an extra step. It doesn't add anything to the gameplay. It takes away from it since it's actively interrupting whatever you're doing. And it costs resources.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way?

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, hope you're having a good week. I was very much into D&amp;D about a decade ago, but mostly played 3.5E, and I'm trying to get my head around 5E rules. I'm playing a warlock and there are some things about the class I think I'm not understanding as I level up. I apologize in advance if these questions have already been asked - I've done a decent bit of searching on Reddit and Google and can't find concrete answers, so here I am. Maybe they're just too basic to merit responses!\n\n1. When I level up, and I have the opportunity to replace spells, it seems like I can swap out level 1 spells for level 2 spells in my spell slots. Are warlock spell slots level agnostic? If so, would there ever be a reason to choose a level 1 spell over a level 2 spell?\n2. Are cantrips separate from the spell slots I have? Is Eldritch Blast in its own category as well?\n3. Can a warlock swap spells out of their spell slots at any point in the game besides leveling up? i.e. long rests?\n4. How does concentration work? In my 3.5E addled-brain, concentration has to do with an enemy hitting you while you're casting, but it seems like it has changed in 5E. Does this mean I can only cast one 'concentration' spell at a time?\n5. Are warlocks just permanently set to two spell slots? I'm only at level 4 right now.\n6. On that note, if I have two spell slots, I take that to mean I can only cast two spells of any level per short rest, excluding Eldritch Blast and cantrips - is that correct?\n\nThanks!",

Astarion is getting unique vampires abilities that I'm sure will even get stronger over time, Wyll is definitely getting completely custom patron benefits. There's clear hints that Shadowhearts could get varying powers based on what decisions you make with her. And it seems like that's the direction they're taking with every companion, very similar to the unique and buildwarping source abilities of characters in DoS2.\n\nAnd then there's Tav, who gets nothing really unique, as even the tadpole powers are party wide, and so whatever they become later should probably be expected to be party wide too. So what's the point of playing Tav when they've confirmed that the companions will be selectable as your origin character, too? If they make them customizable, I have a strong fear that Tav will be even more pointless than the custom characters in D2, whom at least had the Dome as something.\n\nThis is a bit of a long post, but I wanted to share my thoughts and fears with the community as we're approaching release date.

Big thumbs up. \n\nLooking forward to the game. I also play a lot of Bannerlord and hopefully by games release I\u2019ll have my new PC bought and paid for. Right now I\u2019m on PS5.\n\nWithout spoiling anything what can you guys twlll me about attacking animations. Stealth kills, character development, and armor/weapon concepts (always disliked the strength armors in DOS cuz they where all way too bulky and always envied my finesse companion\u2019s drip. How does the equipment/weapon equip system fair?\n\nLastly is it fully voiced? I\u2019m worried that will take away from some of my main characters agency and development if they have to cut back on dialogue options in favor of presentation. \n\nPeace, love, war, and death. It\u2019s all gravy \ud83e\udd23",

            "title": "On characters (mostly paladins) starting with heavy armor.",
            "selftext": "**TLDR:** The arguments against starting with heavy armor have lots of holes in them. The heavy armor people want to start with is chainmail, not plate mail. Yes I know it is early access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people on this sub (mostly those who understand what paladins are supposed to be) think that paladins should have their correct starting equipment. There are also those who think they shouldn't (despite pretty much every other class getting the correct gear). I want to clarify that the heavy armor in this case is chainmail, which would have the same ac as scale mail with maxed dex bonus, without requiring any dex. This would allow for builds that don't put points into dex to not be gimped in the beginning. Paladins aren't the only class that can start with chainmail (fighters and three cleric subclasses can too), but by default they only start with chainmail. Also I tried to get data on if any paladins used scale mail on r/DnD, but it was such a dumb question, with such an obvious answer, that I shouldn't have asked, so I'm going forward without the data and saying that no paladin would even own scale mail. So now I'm going to go through every argument I can think of or find against paladins getting the correct armor, which may not be all of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**We wouldn't have the correct equipment because the Nautaloid kidnapped us.**\n\nThere are a couple variations of this one. The first is that we wouldn't have had the time to put our armor on. There are two problems with this: 1. In the intro the Nautaloid attacks Baldur's Gate during the day, evidently between late morning and early afternoon, so any adventurer would likely have their armor on, and 2. paladins apparently have enough time to put on an armor that they wouldn't even own, along with their tabard/surcoat, and then get their weapon and shield. Another version is that the Nautaloid would have stripped us, to which I say: 1. It should have stripped everyone else of gear, such as Shadowheart, and 2. a guard in the intro keeps his armor when grabbed by the Nautaloid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Its a video game and so it makes sense you don't get the good armor.**\n\nFirst off, chainmail isn't that good of armor. You're probably thinking of plate mail, which no level 1 character should have. Secondly it is only builds that dump dex and use armor which are hurt by this choice, any dex based build that uses armor is fine as they all start with, or have easy access to, great-amazing armor for them. Mages don't need top put points into dex to be fine, but they get the correct starting gear. Heavy armor based builds don't get their full starting kit, and because of it are disadvantaged at the beginning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A DM could limit armor choices so Larian can to.**\n\nThis is technically correct. But no DM *would* do this. Limiting only heavy armor would screw over any armored strength based character. It would be an unpopular decision that likely would lose players. Limiting all starting equipment (such as the \"start in a prison without gear\" scenario) is different, as it affects all (or half if it's just restricting armor) of the classes. I haven't ever heard of a DM restricting just heavy armor for character creation, though if someone actually has (and isn't just making it up) let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final notes and thoughts.**\n\nRing mail is bad, it has the same ac as scale without the dex bonus. No one uses ring mail. The only reason it would be better than scale is if you had a 9 or lower in dex. Also Lae'zel starts in the room with us during the intro cutscene, with her armor (which is the best medium armor type). I would be fine starting with no equipment, or even specifically unarmored (but having weapons), as long as it was applied to all classes equally. The current system isn't. It should be noted that in 5e, paladins at character creation can only get chainmail if you go with the starting equipment. Another note is that in 5e, plate mail is supposed to be more common than pretty much any magic items. I know that you can get chainmail, but it is all in areas for made for higher level parties, and chainmail's value is 400, twice the cost of splint in 5e, and over 5 times the cost of chainmail in 5e. I also understand that the game is still in early access, this post is a response to these arguments, which I feel don't make much sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntro video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHEw36gTwU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHEw36gTwU)\n\nPoll post link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/12pquhd/does_your_paladin_use_scale_mail/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/12pquhd/does_your_paladin_use_scale_mail/)",

I like Wizards, but I love the different succubus-like spells warlock has. (charm, hex, etc)\n\nLately, I've been trying a bard, and I've enjoyed it, but I still feel like something is missing. Am I able to, for instance, grab \"find familiar\" from the wizard class using the magic initiate thing? Am I able to take certain charm, hex skills from the warlock school of magic? \n\nBasically, I'd love to be able to customize it to what I enjoy, since multiclass isn't a thing now.

            "selftext": "K, I gotta get this off my chest. I LOVE this game. I've put in hundreds of hours, even though I've never actually finished Act 1 cause I'll either hit a spot I get hopelessly stuck in and decide to start over, or want to try out a different race/class combo, or a new patch comes out and I'll restart to see what's in it.\n\nBut oh... my... god I hate Lae'zel. I honestly can't think of another companion character from any game I've ever played that I loathed more.\n\nFirst, as a long-time D&amp;D player (and DM) she's the exact thing every experienced player or DM tells new players NOT to make. The golden rule is \"make a team player\" not.... ya know... the most hostile and unfriendly personality imaginable, who hates everyone, all the time, and deserves to be shanked in her sleep.\n\nThis makes it all the more frustrating that she was put in THIS game of all games, as literally the only viable tank option in early access. What were Larian thinking? In a game that prides itself on having a ton of options and letting you \"play your way\" you basically have three options - play an incredibly squishy, probably doomed all-range party, deal with \"Lae'zel disapproves\" popping up every 5 seconds and your party continuously bickering, or make your PC the tank so you don't need her. Not exactly a wealth of options there.\n\nI DEEPLY hope we get a couple more tank options in full release, so I can do THE RIGHT THING in the scene when you re-recruit her and &gt;!put her out of MY misery!&lt;.",

Would having voice overs improve or make your game experience worse?\n\nEdit:\n\nReading the comments, I see many are in favour of an open template, pure RPG experience.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve been playing the game with the mindset of letting the game take me on a journey, just as in Witcher 3 or CP2077.\n\nI can see the appeal for silent tav now.

Generally I can hit 120fps at ultra, though I have it capped at 100fps for the sake of stability as I've noticed some areas that can be a little more intense. \n\nUnfortunately, while my GPU can reach higher framerates while zoomed out, whenever I move the camera close to the ground, my fps will drop to around 80-90fps.

            "selftext": "As in patch 7 and [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/wcwrdn/glitchfest_patch_8_complete_list_of_bugs/), I've been noting all the glitches I encountered during my gameplay in current patch. Most of them are little goofs that are hard to avoid in such huge games like BG3, but the others were regular problems. Also, translation glitches are described in [special post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/12ug441/translation_mistakes_glitchfest_patch_9_teaser/). All of it happened on High graphic settings.\n\n**Glitch of the patch:** I tossed an axe into goblin. It one-shot him in critical strike. And his corpse flied up for a few metres high, then dropped!\n\n1. Critical strikes (with everything: spells, weapons, familiars' natural attacks) doesn't deal double damage in most cases. (But critical strikes made by enemies work normal.) Some examples:\n   1. I cast Inflict Wounds III (5d10) and it dealt only 45 damage. It's less than maximal DMG, without even mentioning about doubling it (what should happen in case of critical strike).\n   2. Shadowheart's critical strike (with Dagger +1) dealt only **3 f***ing damage** to Dror Ragzlin. He has resistance against physical damage, but it's ridiculously small for critical strike.\n2. Spilled blood removes dangerous terrain, like bushes or acid.\n3. My camera glued to the cliff over the dark gem in phase spiders' chamber (to the one where eggs lie on top of it).\n4. The shorter iron candelabres in the moonstone puzzle room are both glitched - when you light them, the fire appears under them, not on the top of it.\n5. I can't touch the small candle (with the cursor) on the northern-western pillar over the moonstone puzzle.\n6. Summoned creatures (like familiar or risen undead) can't follow to Underdark through the ladder under the ruined temple. They get stuck in moonstone puzzle room, forever.\n7. The hair on the Haste Helm glitches a lot during cutscenes. Sam as mask of Cap of Wrath.\n8. Jarrus' notebook under the skeleton is really hard to pick.\n9. BOTH Astarion and Gale are reading cursed book after you find it, even before you find the gem opening it.\n10. The Helmet of Smiting looks different in-game than on icon. Same about Sussur Dagger and Adamantine Scale Mail (that doesn't have scales anyway).\n11. Informations about items that Gale can eat appear before he tells about his disease.\n12. Gale is mentioned as interested in magic items while finding them, even after he left the camp forever.\n13. Spore Servants looks normal in cutscenes.\n14. Some usable items (potions, bulbs, javelins etc.) doesn't want to gather in one slot.\n15. Keys remain in the inventory forever, even when You don't need them anymore. It's not a glitch, but it's annoying.\n16. Killing Gekh Coal made the journal saying that all duergars were killed, and antitoxin for Thulla found. None of this was truly made at this point.\n17. Sometimes the target is declared as being too far to attack in melee (especially for familiars), but the successfull attack is possible.\n18. An options to give Thulla normal antitoxin and special one (from duergars) look identical. So You have no idea which one you will lose.\n19. You see only darkness outside from the drow's hideout in myconid camp. (And vice versa.)\n20. Tav's portraits in Inpiration Points look like basic option in character creator.\n21. Some bibberbangs around Baelen survive the mass explosion and flames.\n22. Attacks from enemies are glitched - their effects appear lately or animations doesn't happen. Examples:\n   1. An effect of hook horror's basic attack happened after a few seconds. (And same to some attacks on them.)\n   2. The attack from Wood Woak was invisible. He didn't perform an animation. (He missed.)\n   3. Buthir the ogre attacked Tav. Nothing happened. After a few seconds Tav made dodge, attack missed and the round was over.\n23. Sometimes characters in the company are forced to skip their rounds in combat.\n24. Sometimes, enemies also skip their rounds or attack randomly.\n25. Using Bitter Divorce (the rod that summons zombie Connor) does nothing and wastes the action instead of working.\n26. After placing Sussur Wood in the furnance, I couldn't scroll my inventory.\n27. The furnance in blacksmith's house uses an icon of the statue.\n28. Color Spray (from the ring) doesn't work on targets that have any kind of high or low ground. Even if the difference is very small.\n29. The small ledge on path to spectator's arena (near the Selunite outpost) is so high that it needs to be jumped through. Despite of it looks like a normal ledge, easy to pass.\n30. When Tav is lying down (like by falling on oil or ice) in moment of ending the battle, Tav stops reacting for commands after standing up (and can't be shoved). The only option to wake Tav up is to knock down.\n31. While picking item up by instantly sending to other character, rest of the items in the box (or corpse etc.) may disappear ot be instantly picked up.\n32. Spell Aid's decription doesn't explain how much HP it grants.\n33. When opening and loading the game, Lae'zel's concentration on Shield of Tyr is being disrupted.\n34. Sickle of BOOOAAAL doesn't have a definied weapon type.\n35. During long rest in Underdark, Tav's bed disappeared in lying scene.\n36. Potions of Acid and Poison Resistance look almost identical. It's not a glitch, but it's annoying.\n37. Antitoxin and Potion of Animal Speaking look extremaly similar. It's also annoying. (It also affects Potion of Strength, that had unique icon once.)\n   1. Potion of Strength's description uses it's old icon. (Better one, IMO.)\n38. During battle with Ragzlin, I cound't see the wooden bars over the arena, where I wanted to teleport. It was once easy to see them with normal camera.\n39. Duergars attacked me after I sneak-attacked eye of vision, despite of they asked me to destroy it. And I did it in hiding, far away from them.\n40. Sometimes when I want to drop some items (crystals, sack of smokepowder etc.) the game tells me to leap to reach targeted place (?).\n41. Enemies empower their attacks like idiots. Examples:\n   1. Dalthar the duergar used poison on her weapon **after** the first attack, before the second one. She wasted it in 50% so.\n   2. Duergar used Mark of the Hunt on Tav, than attacked Lae'zel twice.\n42. Portraits of some basically dead characters (like gnomes in Grymforge) show bodyparts or nothing. Also, one of them looks like surface characters (like goblin?).\n43. Portraits of duergar zombies show their chests.\n44. The description of Urchin's achievement for getting the ring from dead gnome says about dropping the corpses into the river. It's actualy lake, not a river.\n45. Characters can activate some spells that already work (like Heat Metal) in the area of Silence.\n46. Fighting on the stairs makes the camera mad and falling under the ground. Some problem with ground level, I guess. Examples:\n   1. First stairs in Grymforge's harbour where you appear.\n   2. Stairs to the house where ogres eat the dead tiefling.\n47. After talking with deep rothe (by Speak with Animals), the camera fell underground.\n48. Eyes of deep rothe look weird when he blinks.\n49. I found duergars and rothes trying to break the wall after I killed Nere and other duergars. Not only duergars, but also rothes were hostile at this point.\n50. Tossing bag of smokepowder into loose stones (that imprison Nere) annoyed NPCs around, despite of I wanted to destroy the rocks in this way.\n51. I joined Nere in killing angry duergars. Some of them who stand at our side started attacking each other or Nere. Despite of being marked as allies by green colour.\n52. Clicking on Leap icon removed it from the toolbar.\n53. Characters standing on the deck on front part of nautiloid (over posessed chef) are actualy standing over it, in the air. Shadows reveal it easily.\n54. After I press Alt-Tab to note some glitch in nautiloid, the music gets extremaly silent. It doesn't come back even for cutscenes. However, dialogues worked normally. (It was funny to listen Shadowheart's random moaning during dramatic cutscene of planar shifts.)\n55. The red arrow pointed that stunned Commander Zhalk can perform ocasional attack, but nothing like that happened.\n56. Zhalk detonated acid (from Acid Bulb) around him with his sword. The explosion knocked him aside, than he slided back to the starting place.\n57. After standing up he leaped to the place where he was knocked, then again slided back to the starting place.\n58. Before the cutscene with falling nautiloid, Tav shown up standing on the beach for a short moment.\n59. I stoped hearing most of sounds over the dead fisherman where the comment about bad luck happens. Where I moved away, sounds went back.\n60. One of the skeletons in the tomb got insane and started running from the party instead of chasing them. Without Turning Undead.\n61. I robbed \"dead\" skeletons from everything. When i killed them again, they had some gold in the pockets.\n62. Leveling up to 2 as fighter doesn't give any choice. Despite of it, I had to wait few seconds until \"ACCEPT\" button was possible to click on.\n63. Shadowheart leaped to leave an oiled area. After landing, she slided back (?!) and made succesfull save roll.\n64. Wyll used Help action to \"revive\" Lae'zel who just fell on ice and had full HP. Is rising simply fallen companions glitch or interaction I didn't know having over 500 hours?\n65. After killing bugbear assassin, Nadira started sitting on the rock than standing up again and again (without sitting / standing animation). And her tail got crazy.\n66. Lakrissa's skin color changed from purple (in previous patches) to greyish blue. I am not sure is it update or glitch.\n67. After cutscene with Arabella, Rath sit on the rock instantly, without an animation.\n68. I sped up rolling the dice (having plenty buffs). The result shown up as 9, and the roll was succesful. The roll's target was at least 12.\n69. Slowly-opening doors (like in Emerald Enclave) can be passed through before they fully open; the characters simply walk through them.\n70. Alfira doesn't hold her lute in her hands in-game. Also, her robe looks black on arms when watching from far.\n71. Also, while sitting on the rock, she was repeating parts of her song again and again in the weird way.\n72. Wyll can summon quasit (the demon). But he has pact with the devil, and devils hates demons.\n73. I ordered SH to toss Acid Bulb over her range, so she run to reach the target. The bulb (suprisingly big) was floating over her hand in this time.\n74. I couldn't pick up the daggers I tossed into harpy - her corpse blocked them. Despite of the corpse fell of the cliff, and daggers where lying on it's top.\n75. Sometimes the camera gets very high and it's impossible to move it as close as normally. (It actualy gives the great view and should be remade into controllable option.)\n76. Playing bard's song makes your non-working companions in the camp acting like regular NPCs. (Coming close and tossing gold.)\n77. The key found in corpse in the cave with statues under the grove didn't disarm the chest it opens.\n78. Healing potion in front of Selune's statue in the owlbear's cave is standing in the middle of stone.\n79. Ethel didn't disappear after I supported Mayrina's brothers in threatening her. Than the cutscene started where one of them commented it.\n80. Some thorny roots didn't burn (visually) alongside with the rest of it's area. In practice, it was burned.\n81. Keys (0,01 weight) are declared as too heavy to be tossed.\n82. After the long rest when Raphael appeared, SH's portrait declared her as separated from rest of the party. But she followed Tav as normal. Until I switched character on her - it really separated her.\n83. While aiming with Scorching Ray, Wyll shot after declaring **second** target - despite of this attack insludes **three** rays.\n84. Angry redcaps entering Ethel's house ignored imp standing in doors. He didn't join the fight despite of standing close to them.\n85. Ethel's corpse was declared as enemy in battle despite of she was dead. When I killed redcap standing on it, she \"died\" properly.\n86. Redcap Sage moved to Ethel's corpse, looked at it and skipped his turn. That's all.\n87. The game stated that projectile's path is clear (and moved Gale to attack from here), but the attack hit the obstacle between caster and target.\n88. Tav opened the wardrobe on balcony inside Ethel's house (over the entrance) while standing under the balcony, in the entrance.\n89. The basket on the balcony outside Ethel's house (with tea pots) is partially inside the floor.\n90. Some items (Potion of Animal Speaking, baskets etc.) in pantry in Ethel's house are hovering in the air.\n91. The Healing Potion standing in the highest ground inside Ethel's house can't be picked up - it seems to be inside the chimney's wall.\n92. There are actualy TWO mirrors near the potion described above. One of them is below the second, partially in the floor.\n93. The Potion of Greater Healing near Ethel's chimney-entrance to underground is inside the wall and can't be picked up.\n94. I wanted to talk with some characters after they left area of Silence and I desactivated it, but they were still silenced - forever. Including Tav! Long Rest removed glitch from Tav, who was able to talk and cast spells again. But NPC were silenced forever.\n95. Rush Attack (special attack with spear) doesn't affects first hit enemy, but the targeted one. Even if the other is on the path.\n96. While aiming with Rush Attack to the target that stays in doors, the mark where character will be moved appears on top of the doors.\n97. Using Disguise Self near sitting NPCs causes them to stand up than shake or sit down rapidly.\n98. Also, it allows to repeat dialogues with friendly NPCs like you appear them for the first time.\n99. Female tiefling of Zariel in dream character creator had basically \"no horns\" option on, but she appeared with horns. Changing \"horns\" option fixed it.\n100. Loading the location after long rest shows characters lying on the ground for a few seconds.\n101. Slow-walk animation doesn't happen to Tav in the mud, despite of being slowed down. The steps are normal, but Tav moves slowly.\n102. When (out of battle) I turn to companions with healing spell, they all start running around Tav to stand behind his back. They run away from being targeted!\n103. The Oak Father's Embrace armor has completely different color while leveling up than during gameplay. Is this glitch or matter of lightening?\n104. While picking \"Martial Adept\" feat for Battlemaster, all of options were basically chosen - with one exception.\n105. After changing character's card from Tav to Gale, stats still belonged to Tav instead of Gale.\n106. While opening the boxes their lids move, but the items lying on them - don't.\n107. Ilyn Toth's notebooks in the basement are inside the tables instead of on it.\n108. Light spell cast on Gale (with Corellon's staff) granted him Resistance buff (from staff) instead of working.\n   1. This spell doesn't work instantly after casting, you need to switch weapon to other, then back to empowered one.\n109. Ethel's House, Arcane Tower and Gnome Village were still marked on the map despite of I finished all quests connected with them.\n110. After I loaded the game in the camp, Wyll and Astarion (companions not in party) shown up in underwear for a moment. Nice.\n111. While standing on rock over Shadowheart's tent I can't open choice menu of some items in my equipment.\n112. I cast Ray of Enfeeblment on Fezzerk from hiding on high ground. The game correctly aimed for his feet, then the attack hit the ground (missed) without stopping hiding and joining the fight.\n113. After stopping the windmill, Barcus is sitting on his chains like a boss.\n114. After I left the basement under the windmill (that I stopped), the windmill was rotating like crazy for a moment.\n115. After I killed Buthir the ogre, her angry bugbear BF yelled a few lines at the same time.\n116. No companion acted as sick (despite of glowing green) during first night of tadpole dreams.\n117. The message about learning new illithid power popped out before the dream started (right after picking an option to rest).\n118. During the first dream I seen Wyll's imp behind Tav's back spying on him and his waifu XD\n119. Tossing the goblin spear in camp during sick night (before first dream) doesn't work. Projectile's path is always described as blocked.\n120. Leather Helmet on Shadowheart's head has some white patches inside, under her ears.\n121. Also, pointy ears of characters like elves are piercing through helmets.\n122. I needed to click twice for hiding SH to disarm the drap - first to get close enough, second to disarm it. Both times it was an order to disarm it.\n123. Some surfaces that should be temporary (web, poison etc.) remain forever.\n124. Fire Arrow (that should create area of fire no matter was the attack succesful) didn't ignite the spiderweb after it missed the spider that sit on it. Same about Chromatic Orb.\n125. Lae'zel didn't turn frontally to spiderweb bridge that was her target of Acid Arrow.\n126. The lightening between forest and the Risen's Road changes pretty rapidly (over broken stone bridge).\n127. Instead of exploding at targeted place, Acid Splash stopped on the enemy in it's way. I am not sure is it normal.\n128. I cast Speak with Dead on dead warlock inside Anders' base while standing outside. The cutscene shown both corpse and Tav outside.\n129. Rurik tossed bomb so effectively that it's explosion reached his fellow Anders, killing him. Best friend ever.\n130. After ending Karlach's sidequest and last talk with her, the camera flied away for a moment.\n131. Entering Waukeen's Rest from entrance above, where Benryn lies, is really annoying. You have to destroy the door, than get in by leap, with no place for landing.\n132. Benryn doesn't lie under the wood but sits inside the floor.\n133. Round-by-round mode glitched in Waukeen's Rest and I couldn't end it.\n134. I couldn't touch with cursor these chests in room behind Benryn (where Hammerheaft is hidden).\n135. I spoke with the dead drow in front of Waukeen's rest skipping his lines and his corpse remained glowing green after the cutscene. (I couldn't speak with him no more.)\n136. After opening the box with Benryn's ring, Tav's way out is blocked by the box.\n137. Dancing Lights doesn't give light in the room with explosive barrels, when you meet Zhentarim trying to blow Tav up.\n138. Some characters in goblin camp (like Crusher) ignore the massive battle in it. You need to get close to them to make them join the fight.\n139. Andrick gave no sh*t that I just slaughtered entire goblin camp around him (by explosive barrels), including Brynna and owlbear cub.\n140. Summoned Worg didn't perform a activate-sprinting animation.\n141. Items in shops doesn't explain does chosen and purchasing character can use it, but only can Tav use it.\n142. During fight with Spike, he called Wyll pussycat and told about drows capturing Mizora twice - in his first and second turn.\n143. During the same battle the camera started colliding with the wall on the right to the room's entrance.\n144. After casting Dancing Lights on small enemy (like average goblin), characters trying to aim this enemy aim for lights over it. You must target enemy's portrait to reach this one.\n145. Liam talks about going to the druid's grove, but he actualy disappears after leaving goblins' base.\n146. Vision of Absolute (combined with shield) disappeared from Tav's back during playing \"How to Murder the Blade\" cutscene.\n147. After talking with Ragzlin, camera jumped to the left and got stuck between the rocks far behind the wall.\n148. Ragzlin refuses to talk with dead illithid no matter which dialogue option do you choose.\n149. After I started the battle with Ragzlin by talking with him sitting on his throne, he started the battle inside the throne.\n150. During battle with Ragzlin, some enemies were marked as neutral units at some points. But they were ABSOLUTEly (hehe) hostile.\n151. I cast Find Familiar during the battle, after Gale stand up from lying on the ground. Looks like casting this spell is possible in battle despite of the description.\n152. The camera fell underground while turning to enemy that just started his round.\n153. The lightening in dark places (like Minthara's room) reflects in characters' eyes a little too strong. As the result they always glow, overwhelming eyes' color and pupils.\n154. Familiars forget to use ocasional attacks.\n155. After casting Fire Bolt, Gale hidden his scepter behind his back and started fist fight animation for a moment.\n156. During the battle with Ragzlin, one of goblins decided to shove illithid's corpse for some reason.\n157. After imp (standing on stairs in Ragzlin's room) killed a goblin standing on balcony with wardrum, goblin's corpse flied over imp and landed behind him.\n158. Brakkal (imprisoned goblin cleric) was angry for disarming the trap keeping him in the cage and refused to talk with me.\n159. Wyll's eye lands in my equipment when I send him to the camp, despite of it's HIS eye and I completely don't need it.\n160. Lakrissa was walking without a weapon while preperations to the battle, but in cutscenes she had a bow.\n161. After loading the game while preparations to the battle, Lakrissa was invisible. After I ended talking with Kaldani, she apeared from nowhere near us.\n162. Colors of Vision of Absolute on Tav's back changes (from brown to grey) when the camera is far away from it. In grove's sunlight at least.\n163. Tav was marked as buffed by purple ball on portrait because of Love of Loviatar - despite of the true buff was not working yet.\n164. Doni is marked on the map - it makes the quest of finding him ridiculously easy.\n165. Raven familiar got stupid after the party left him behind by using the elevator in the grove - and didn't fly up nor searched for way to follow them. It just stayed in place.\n166. There's a javelin impaled in the rock where Zevlor stays before the battle. I think bugbear tossed it during first battle, and no one picked it up. But tieflings were ungry about picking it up.\n167. For some reason the gate to the grove is freakin opened during the battle! (It looked like opened, but was closed. When detroyed, it fell correctly.)\n168. Some enemies during battle for the grove are neutral until Minthara's first turn. They don't fight, just watch and heal after being wounded. Ok, it's the next wave, but why they stay so close?\n169. I destroyed the barrels with goblins that ogre was meant to toss. He got stupid and stopped acting.\n170. Ogre was standing in the middle of burning area, but got no damage nor catch fire.\n171. Ice Chromatic Orb didn't freeze the blood around.\n172. Lightning Charges dealt electric damage (1) twice to one target in one spell.\n173. I can't cast Bane on the battlefield with Shadowheart standing on top of grove's gate.\n174. Minthara left area of Silence and runed from the gate - to the cliff ending with Quick Travel sign. Like trying to attack from this side. (After few rounds of skipping, she came back to frontal attack.)\n175. While trying to aim her from above, the camera was stucking in the cliff.\n176. Minthara's corpse started shaking wildly after dying from cat's claws... Yeah, understandable. Pretty humiliating death for such proud drow like her.\n177. I shoved Minthara's corpse under the gate and it fell underground. After loading the game the body was on surface again.\n178. You can date with Lakrissa (by Dyplomacy check) twice - before and after the battle. Both improves Shadowheart's approval.\n179. Message about companion wanting to talk doesn't appear when you're leaving the camp in the morning after having a dream with tadpole. (Second, cave camp.)\n180. Spell Aid works eternaly when cast on friendly NPCs. It doesn't disappear with a long rest. Same about Mage's Armor and other spells that doesn't end with time nor require concentration.\n181. Cat familiar can't walk onto elevator in the grove, it needs to jump on it. (Walking familiars generally have problems with stairs.)\n182. Familiars are pretty bad in finding way to the party when they are far away.\n183. Level 2 spells didn't fade from my toolbar after casting the last possible of them (Aid).\n184. I placed the box in the camp, where Alfira stays. During the party she was standing on it, falling then climbing back from time to time.\n185. Bonuses from spells doesn't work on checks during in-flagranti scenes (like romances and third dream), despite of you can add them.\n186. At some point, when I wanted to open the sack, this option was called \"Close\", but it opened the sack correctly. (I closed it a moment before.)\n187. Concussive Smash (special attack with mace, Xyande) hit the target (enemy passed save roll), but didn't deal any damage.\n188. Throwing Potion of Animal Speaking at someone doesn't grant the buff to target.\n189. Polma's (she-ogre's) mace acted weird while her Slam attack with fists.\n190. After I loaded the game and entered the Underdark (with ladder) for the first time, my team members separated.\n191. Mintaur attacking the gate to Selunite Outpost didn't make any sound nor damage with his charge.\n192. Attacks with thrown weapons (like javelins) deal some extra bludgeoning damage sometimes. Even when the attack misses.\n193. After I killed their boss during fight with spectator, drows started skipping their rounds.\n194. One of kuo-toas was angry at me right after I entered, like I stole something. I did nothing like this yet.\n195. I tossed BOAAAL while fighting against him alone. All kuo-toas were simply watching our battle, but after it, they joined as hostile to me. (Marked as neutral by yellow, BTW.)\n196. BHOAAL's death didn't scare kuo-toas.\n197. Healing some wounded NPCs (like jobless companion's familiar) often provokes them to heal themselves fully.\n198. Tav cast Aid on Wyll's imp twice: before and after leaving them in the camp. It worked both times, raising it's HP twice (to 20).\n199. After casting third Aid (by Shadowheart), imp's HP fell to 15.\n200. While speaking with dead drow near schroom staircase in Underdark some weird grey shapes (skin of his chest?) pierces through his shirt.\n201. Mark of incoming bulette appears on the map (at least in it's supposed lair) even after bulette is dead.\n202. After I failed check in carrion crawler's nest, the camera started showing Tav from above (like in normal gameplay) during chosing next dialogue option.\n203. Clicking on the ladder often makes character climb up than back down.\n204. **Glowing** magical cannon is still obscured in shadows.\n205. Crafting (like in Grymforge) is often declared as failed (by red marking) for a moment, despite of it works correctly.\n206. There is some pipe outside of Arcane Tower that can be spotted with succesfull check - but can't be interacted with.\n207. Explosion of smokepowder bomb removed spilled oil from it's area of effect (without igniting it).\n208. Hook horror leaped from area of sussur flower, but it's effect was working on it endlessly. It was invulnerable to spells like color spray.\n209. Flaming Fists' shield on Tav looked like burning despite of the only effects on him were Blessing of Sylvanus, Love of Loviatar and Aid.\n210. Using redcap's sickle in the furnance where sussur is forged glitches the game and doesn't allow to close crafting window in a standard way nor interact with furnance again.\n211. When Omeluum offered me his quest (and I already had fungus he asks for), the only dialogue options were to reject it or attack him.\n212. Murmath's spiders were invisible. Or fell underground. I couldn't see or click them. After watching at dead drow's stats, they appeared back!\n213. Why Resistances among stats doesn't desribe immunities to effects like fear? It would be useful.\n214. Lightning Charges description doesn't explain that you need to deal **electrical** damage to deal extra 1d8 damage.\n215. Basic Lightning Charges deal 1 point of damage to only one target, even if you hit many targets with one spell.\n216. My attack at Ochre Jelly was declared as disadvantaged because of being obscured by shadows. It had 90% of success anyway, what looks suspicious.\n217. Torches on slopes on path to Philomene's hideout flash rhythmically while appearing on the edges of the screen for the first time.\n218. After getting runepowder from Philomene I found Stinkshit (gnome slave bringing the alcohol) standing over dead duergars who bullied him. He thanked me like I killed them and went straight into elevator.\n   1. Also, he says about going to myconid camp as to safe place, but doesn't appear here with other gnomes. He just disappears. Did something eat him during journey?\n219. I ignited runepowder with Alchemic Fire (to free Nere), creating area of fire. One of freed gnomes went into it and got DMG. All duergars and Nere instantly attacked me for it.\n220. All the gnomes attacked me because I accidentally ignited some box with Alchemic Fire while fighting against their opressors.\n221. While fighting duergars, all the gnomes were panicking. Only Barcus stand in basic pose and watched like a boss.\n222. After I killed Nere and turned against rest of Duergars, some of them went away. Like this one lady in mask with halabard.\n223. Looting Kith's (and his helper's) corpses annoyed gnomes - but looting other dead enemies didn't.\n224. Looting ring from Nere's corpse made Tav turning away from the body.\n225. After cutting off Nere's head, his corpse stand up for a moment.\n226. Sometimes, the surfaces like oil have the long, empty line inside. However, the line still works like the rest of surface.\n227. Hitting duergar from above with Fire Arrow ignited objects far away from him.\n228. Shoving Mimic in disguise started silent conversation that didn't end. The only way out was to attack.\n229. Rotating mimic's model while checking it's stats makes the model close up and vice versa again and again.\n230. On the bridge to idol of Shar - around traps - lonely Shadowheart's moves were freezing in the middle of walking whenever she stopped. Her standing animation wasn't happening.\n231. Wielding merregon's halbard glitches frontal part of hide in githyanki armor on Lae'zel if she replaced Sword of Tyr with it in her arms.\n232. Internal fire is still burning inside Infernal Hog even when it's dead.\n233. Scroll of Haste has no icon.\n234. ADAMANTINE chest has a description saying it's made of rock and gold.\n235. First line in dialogue with ghost in amulet (activated by special action) is missing. (It works as hiding the amulet back.)\n236. I ordered Lae'zel to move onto one of lavaproof platforms (on arena of Grym), but she stopped on the box where forms for metal should be put in.\n237. The box for item forms in the forge is marked as bedroom.\n238. After hitting hot Grym with hammer, Tav said that that it didn't hurt him - but it worked.\n239. Grym's seismic rage buff does nothing.\n240. When Grym's target of vengence is behind his range (like over the arena) he attacks nearest target without de-marking his target.\n241. Enfeeblemnet (by Gale's ray) stoped working on Grym at some point, despite of Gale wasn't de-concentrated or something. It happened a few times.\n242. Special arrows (acid, fire etc.) can be shot in fighter's **second** attack, but shooting them as **first** attack prevents performing the second one.\n243. Some purely cosmetic objects around Grym's arena are declared as melted when lava flows. Also, his cage is set aflame despite of being metal.\n244. Grymforge music was still playing after I used quick travel to visit Silvanus' grove.\n245. When I ciriticized Shadowheart (who used illithid power) in a cutscene after third dream, I had no choice but to said the second dialogue option (\"Ok, no problem\") after it.\n\nThat's all. Props for people who read this all.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, first time posting on this subreddit. \n\nSo I know these developers made Divinity Original Sin 2 and I hated that game because it felt like the story was very forced and there was no player choice which made roleplaying completely useless unless you fit the role they made you take. It was also a min-maxing feeling game where if you didn't take the right skills and abilities you would not be able to really progress which I didn't find fun either. My problem is I love D&amp;D and the effort they have apparently made to the game to port 5th edition into the game is pretty awesome and the graphics and the classes being faithful and everything is so cool but I don't really want to spend the money on early access to find out that I'm just playing DOS2 again and kicking myself for it later.\n\nSorry for the paragraph and bad grammar but if you have an opinion and maybe have played both games and maybe if I'm lucky you didn't enjoy DOS2 either then hey it'd be real neat if you have a second to reply to this message :)  Thank you for your time.",

            "title": "Brand new lore series bringing us up to BG3's release!",
            "selftext": "Hello all!  \nI started a brand new Sunday video lore series that will bring us up all the way to the official release of BG3. The goal of this series is to provide a **foundation** of Forgotten Realms lore knowledge, with a focus on lore that I feel is *important* when relating to Baldur's Gate 3 specifically (so not just random D&amp;D lore). There will be **no** early access spoilers in these videos, they are simply meant to provide information that will enhance your BG3 experience when you play. So far I am three videos into this series with potentially 15-20 more to go, aiming for a new one every Sunday at 12PM EST.  \n\n\nThe first video deals with the **Dead Three** &amp; their ascension to Godhood**.** The Dead Three are a group of quasi-deities that Larian has specified will play a major role in BG3.   \n[https://youtu.be/3tnbigSohkw](https://youtu.be/3tnbigSohkw)  \n\n\nThe second video deals with the **setting** of BG3. The game takes place in the forgotten realms &gt; the realmspace &gt; planet of Toril &gt; continent of Faerun &gt; Sword Coast. There's plenty of important locations to take note of.  \nhttps://youtu.be/7fXbxMWQFmQ\n\n\nAnd the most recent third video deals with a prominent villain of the realms who will at the very least be referenced several times in BG3, but could even possibly play a big role in the game. This is none other that the supreme Lich ruler of Thay himself, Szass Tam.  \nhttps://youtu.be/8D44Ak_X1_I\n\n\nHope you all enjoy &amp; let me know here if you have any recommendations for future video topics. Crazy that we are in the home stretch now.  I have been intently following this game for almost 4 years, ever since Larian dropped that initial game reveal trailer.",

            "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, I love the plot and the story, and there's so much to explore in the early access, so much cool stuff in just the starter area. But you're bound to encounter the Druid Grove before anything else significant, which offers you a direct plot arc to pursuing a method to remove the tadpole. So, narratively speaking, the player's party has little incentive to explore anywhere that isn't directly related to the leads they've received regarding curing their affliction, because of the sense of urgency the game continues to press onto the party. \n\nCuring the tadpole feels like it needs to be the first thing you do, which is a little frustrating for me because I feel like whenever I go exploring, it's kinda meta because I know that I won't actually turn into a Mind Flayer. But, rationally, my player wouldn't know that, and the party would probably not be fans of going off to some random ruin searching for riches when any moment their transformation could begin.\n\nTL;DR - I think the sense of urgency put forward by the tadpole premise takes away the fun of exploration a little bit, makes it feel like we shouldn't be exploring despite all the side content available.\n\nPotential solution: Early on, perhaps after finding Halsin, a temporary solution is found? Something that will cause the tadpole to become more dormant, opening the way for more flexible exploration.",

There's no error and no action is used.\n\nI most often notice this right at the beginning of combat. Is this a known bug? Are there any workarounds? I can't seem to figure out what condition triggers it, aside from being much more common in the initial round of combat. Yes I'm using the character who's turn it is in the initiative order.\n\nEdit, minor spoiler: &gt;!I just unblocked the tunnel with Nere and started a fight with the Duegar. Shadowheart and a Summoned Imp are at the top of initiative.!&lt;My Imp was able to move and attack, but no matter what I do Shadowheart isn't able to perform any actions. She can't cast offensive or defensive spells. She can't attack. When I try to cast an offensive spell the animation begins, but stops abruptly with no spoken component or missile animation. I cannot use a bonus action either. The only thing I can do is move and end turn. WTF?\n\nEdit 2: Ok, in this case I was actually able to cast a spell, but only after I moved. In other cases I still haven't been able to use an action even after moving.\n\nEdit 3: It looks like the same bug happens in this Youtube video at [https://youtu.be/DwixezORG8g?t=398](https://youtu.be/DwixezORG8g?t=398) (interestingly it was NOT at the initiation of combat).

I\u2019ve spent multiple hours in the first \u00ab\u00a0dungeon\u00a0\u00bb, the crypts. I was running around like a dumbass and learned the hard way that this is not what I have to do. I actually have to think strategies and all. I\u2019m a Druid so I\u2019ve morph into a spider and webbed the floor, showed myself to lure the enemies and stepped back.

I was so happy when I finally killed them because that was hard at first, my Druid doesn\u2019t have many hp. \n\nIt feels also really good that the game is \u00ab\u00a0hard\u00a0\u00bb. Nowadays, many RPG (not all ofc)are really easy, if you die you just get rez a few meters back and that\u2019s it. It feels good to finally have a real game over. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m a 5 years old having the happiest day of her life telling you all this but I\u2019m really enjoying the game and has to tell someone about this. \n\nI made a tiefflin bard to play with my bf and I\u2019m going solo with my Druid Drow (didn\u2019t know about the lore but they don\u2019t seem to be appreciated by anyone lol). The only thing I\u2019m sad about is that none of my friends want to play this game but I know that we would cry laughing if they did. This must be so much fun with a party of 4, trolling around, exploding stuff lol, talking in vocal with a knighty voice. \n\nWell that\u2019s it, sorry about the long post, just wanted to say how much I\u2019m enjoying the game. \nGood night fellow adventurers.",

            "title": "Analysis: Best setup for non-combative playthrough in EA",
            "selftext": "This setup is meant to maximize number of potential dialogues and quests first and foremost, as well as to maximize advancements in quests and encounters through dialogue by utilizing class-specific strengths of bard class. Optimal class was chosen based on following criteria:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How many innate* cantrips/spells/cantrips &amp; spells can a class have that influence ability checks\n2. How many of those cantrips/spells/cantrips &amp; spells only have a range on self\n3. How many proficiencies and expertises does a class give\n4. How many class-specific features influence ability checks\n5. How many feats can a class have that influence ability checks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Innate means that cantrips and spells were not acquired through equipment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first 3 criteria Bard (both College of Lore and College of Valour) class came on top. Top 5 classes for the first 2 criteria (note that subclasses have been merged in this table in order to save space):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|SPELL NAME|SELF?|Bard|Druid|Cleric|Wizard|Sorcerer|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Speak with Dead|yes|1|0|1|0|0|\n|Detect Thoughts|yes|1|0|0|1|0|\n|Enhance Ability|no|1|1|1|0|1|\n|Enlarge - Reduce**|no|0|0|0|1|1|\n|Friends|no|1|0|0|1|1|\n|Guidance|no|0|1|1|0|0|\n|Thaumaturgy|yes|0|0|1|0|0|\n|Charm Person|no|1|1|1|1|1|\n|Speak with Animals|yes|1|1|0|0|0|\n|Disguise Self|yes|1|0|0|1|1|\n|Animal Friendship|no|1|1|0|0|0|\n|Eagle's Splendor|no|1|1|1|0|1|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not tested whether or not it has a weight in dialogues\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came to the amount of proficiencies and expertises, Bardic College of Lore gave 5 proficiencies and 2 expertises by level 5, most out of any class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus we conclude that the College of Lore has the biggest innate potential in terms of the scale of dialogue options as well as modifiers for ability checks which can be cast on self. Additionally, it has a highest proficiency and expertise output of all classes. There are 2 debilitating things about a College of Lore build, however: It can't have Thaumaturgy and Guidance cantrips. Guidance cantrip is surmountable as other classes are capable of giving their bonus to the character, but as Thaumaturgy only has a range on self, it can only be inherited through race.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it came to determining the best race for non-combative playthrough, criteria were as follows:\n\n1. Race abilities\n2. Race cantrips\n3. Extra modifiers (skill proficiencies, expertises and advantages)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weight of this criteria (Friends and Thaumaturgy are non-calculable as they are not crude-number modifiers, but we'll get to them soon) is oriented around the equal probability of either of 18 skills firing at any time (in lack of more in-depth data about distribution of ability checks at the moment), and as such is linearly proportional to succeeding at any given ability check under this supposition. Top 12 races with ability points distributed for highest weight:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|RACE|WEIGHT|STR|DEX|INT|WIS|CHA|ANY|OPTIMAL CANTRIP|EXTRA MODIFIERS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Asmodeus Tiefling|41|||1||2||Thaumaturgy||\n|Deep Gnome|40.8||1|2|||||Advantage in stealth|\n|Githyanki|36|2||1|||||1 proficiency in any skill|\n|Gold Dwarf|35||||1|||||\n|High Elf|40||2|1||||Friends|Proficiency in perception|\n|High Half-Elf|40|||||2|2|Friends||\n|Human|40|1|1|1|1|1||||\n|Lightfoot Halfling|40.76||2|||1||Can reroll if 1|Proficiency in stealth|\n|Rock Gnome|40|||2|||||Twice of proficiency bonus to history checks|\n|Shield Dwarf|32||2|||||||\n|Wood Elf|42|||2||1||Friends|Proficiency in perception and stealth|\n|Wood Half-Elf|42|||||2|2||Proficiency in stealth|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately most subraces fall out, leaving only Wood Elf and Asmodeus Halfling. Thaumaturgy and Friends cantrips can't be weighted, as their cantrips are more of utility than crude number modifiers. If we were to weigh them against each other, however, Friends cantrip is more general of the two, and because it influences 4 skills instead of Thaumaturgy's 2, its weight in these crude numbers would be higher by 5.6, making Wood Elf lead Asmodeus Tiefling by 6.6 in weight. However, Friends can also be acquired as a class cantrip by bard, and thus, at the expense of one non-dialogue spell, Bard could instead be an Asmodeus Tiefling, which would grant him the Thaumaturgy cantrip - the only cantrip/spell that has a range on self that bard wasn't able to use, giving him a complete set of tools at the expense of one non-dialogue spell. In other words, if character has a Friends cantrip inherited from Bard class, weight of Asmodeus Tiefling outweights a Wood Elf by 4.6.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm ending this post with recommended Asmodeus Tiefling Bard setup as the optimal character for this playthrough in EA (alternatively INT 14 and WIS 16 could be used):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|8|12|8|16|14|16|\n\n* Any background (not yet sure if proficiencies stack, as College of Lore level 3 bard unlocks proficiencies in Arcana, Intimidation and Sleight of Hand. If they don't stack, just don't pick Charlatan, Sage, Soldier or Urchin)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the [link](https://www.neoseeker.com/baldurs-gate-3/guides/Skill_Checks) provided u/marqmaking represents accurate distribution of skill checks, weight of races after an optimal redistribution of ability points is as follows (notice that top 12 races are the same as in previous analysis):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|RACE|WEIGHT|OPTIMAL CANTRIP|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Asmodeus Tiefling|2919|Thaumaturgy|\n|Deep Gnome|2269.8||\n|Githyanki|2820||\n|Gold Dwarf|2189||\n|High Elf|2307|Friends|\n|High Half-Elf|3034|Friends|\n|Human|3007||\n|Lightfoot Halfling|2829|Can reroll if 1|\n|Rock Gnome|2398||\n|Shield Dwarf|2063||\n|Wood Elf|2282|Friends|\n|Wood Half-Elf|3046||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this case, Half-Elves outweigh other races if we exclude Friends and Thaumaturgy cantrips. When we include those cantrips analogous to previous analysis, Thaumaturgy adds to 708.4 in weight, totaling to 3627.4 for Asmodeus Tiefling, making it yet again the best choice for this playthrough, at the expense of one non-dialogue spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recommended Asmodeus Tiefling Bard setup is slightly different, however, as in this case the choice of background would have its weight (also, notice that in this case choosing INT 14 and WIS 16 instead would be slightly detrimental, unlike in previous analysis where that wasn't the case and those 4 points could be swapped around between two abilities):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|8|12|8|16|14|16|\n\n* Guild Artisan background - gives proficiencies in Persuasion and Insight, making this background highest in weight",

Perhaps some people have figured out even better approaches than the one I came up with or identified flaws in my plans.

He's not scared or disgusted, just calm and matter of fact. Wyll doesn't give approval if you squish the squishable tadpole. Compare Astarion, who benefits from being tadpoled and still approves of the squishing.\n\nIt feels like every other character waxes poetic on the horrors of ceremorphosis, but Wyll dgaf.

I'm also a huge fan of tabletop gaming, 5e in particular, and I love turn-based combat and the Forgotten Realms.\n\nBG1 captured the sense of adventure so well. With the huge world and the beautiful landscapes you really feel like an aspiring adventurer. BG2 tells an epic story with many interesting locales.\n\nI don't know why, but I didn't enjoy DOS2 very much. I really tried hard to like it, but it somehow didn't resonate with me. The map, the camera movement was the worst I think, I kept losing my sense of orientation. The characters, the story and the puzzles were good, but I didn't care much for the presentation. Overall it's hard to put a finger on why exactly DOS2 didn't vibe with me.\n\nSince EA began I've been thinking that BG3 won't be for me either, because it will not really be a continuation of the original saga. Now I've read that there will at least be some recurring elements. I think it would be a shame to miss BG3 for it's good parts, so I'm almost ready to buy it, but I'm afraid I may be completely disappointed with it afterwards. Maybe it's just a matter of managing my expectations, anyone got any advise?\n\nEDIT: Thank y'all for your terrific responses. I think this will be a hard decision either way. All I know is I will play the game at some point. Either I get it now to get a discount on the premium edition, or I wait for a real discount, but then I need to probably wait until at least 2024.",

Can the rest proceed without them?\n3.\tDoes the game difficulty scale to players? Eg if we are just two players together will it be much harder to play than if we have a full group, or does it scale down so it is still doable with just two people?\n4.\tLinked to question 2; If someone does join later will they be bumped to same level as rest or will there be a level difference so it will be much tougher for them to catch up?\n5.\tAre characters locked to a game/campaign or can you use your character (eg you leveled to 10) and join a friends game with your already started character from another game/session?\n\nLooking forward to playing this game.

Starfield and FF16 both look great however I have much more faith in FF16 being able to deliver. With redfall releasing the way it did and rumours of starfield being delayed to its current release due to it apparently being in a worse state than redfall and Fallout76s release. Starfields review scores may suffer the same fate as survivor. I\u2019m sure it will still be a great game but it will increase BG3\u2019s chances.\n\nCRPGs generally don\u2019t get as much attention as FPS or action RPGs so for BG3 to win game of the year, it would be a big moment for the genre. \n\nThoughts?",

They showed the first chosen, General Ketheric Thorm played by J.K. Simmons in the last trailer.  And it seems likely they\u2019ve hired known actors / actresses for the three chosen and that\u2019s part of their marketing strategy leading up to release.\n\nThe last trailer was focused on the General and act one.  And it seems reasonable to assume there\u2019s one chosen for each act. So if they\u2019re showing the second chosen, I think the trailer on June 8th will be our first real look at act two and The Gate (Baldur\u2019s Gate city).\n\nMaybe they\u2019ll throw in a Dragon Born, Half-orc, and monk.\n\nBut it\u2019s really, I\u2019m guessing, going to be our first real look into what\u2019s past act one\u2026\u2026..

            "title": "Optimizing Sorlock for honor mode act 1",
            "selftext": "I'm very interested in playing honor mode exclusively when BG3 releases (my wife convinced me to skip softcore completely) and I've been thinking a lot about how to optimize one of the strongest builds in 5e dnd (which I admittudly have not ever played), the Sorlock. Let me start with the assumptions:\n\n There are legitimate arguments for whether to go 1, 2, 3, or 5 levels of warlock but I'm going to focus on the 2 Warlock/5 Sorcerer build and primarily think about the first 7 levels, which is basically where we can expect to be by the time we leave for moonrise towers.  I think I plan on 3 Warlock at level 8 but I'm not sure. I'm going to assume only PHB material. \n\nI also assume based on my memory that camp supplies will be more limited in honor mode, thus making short rests extremely important and spell economy a high priority\nSome fights you will be able to long rest beforehand but you should not count on being to long rest after every fight. I'm going to assume a short rest after almost every encounter beyond the trivial ones in the early game and a long rest after 3 encounters, thus you will want to budget things like spell slots and sorcery points on this assumption.\n\nI also assume I'll be starting as sorcerer for the constitution proficiency and picking draconic because wild magic can just straight-up kill you. Reducing variance is the highest priority in hardcore playthroughs. I'll be picking extend/twinned/quickened metamagic. \n\nI'll be playing a half drow with stat distribution \n\nStr 8\n\nDex 14\n\nCon 16\n\nInt 8\n\nWis 12\n\nCha 18 (17 +1 from volo's eye which you can pickpocket easily at level 3. This may no longer be available at release!) \n\n\n\nUnlike traditional aRPGs with a hardcore like diablo where if you're under-leveled or under-geared you can just go farm low level mobs, in BG3 the xp is a limited resource and you can very easily get yourself to a point where no more xp is available unless you pass a power checkpoint, especially at higher difficulty such as honor mode.\n\nTo me the *first* critical level appears to be level 4, where you typically will be making a choice between fighting\n\n1) The hag\n\n\n2) The gith\n\n\n3) The druids\n\n\n4)Minthara\n\n5)The spider matriarch\n\nSo many early fights that require a power checkpoint to be passed and all of them typically come pre-level 5 (although some you can put off)\n\nThe question then becomes how do you optimize a build that hits the highest power possible at level 4 such that you can pass all of these checkpoints without save scumming (I assume honor mode will force a save when a companion dies, similar to DOS2) or just dying?  I think I've found the answer but I would love to hear opinions\n\n\nFirst let's consider the possible combinations: \n\n4S\n3S/1W\n2S/2W\n1S/3W\n\nLet's go over the advantages and disadvantages of each:\n\n4Sadvantages: you have 4 level 1 and 3 level 2 spell slots, all your metamagic is available and you have 4 sorcery points. You have access to your ASI so you have +5 Cha and a +7 to spell attacks. Your save DC is the highest at 15.  You know 6 sorcerer spells.\n\nDisadvantages: no short-rest spell slots, weaker cantrips and at level 4 you basically gain a +5% to-hit from ASI, 1 sorcery point and 1 level 2 spell slot, not a big power spoke for that 4th level relative to level 2 and level 3 where you gain metamagic and level 2 spells. You have no warlock powers\n\n3S/1W advantages: you have 2 level 2 spell slots and know 6 sorcerer spells.  2 of those can be level 2.  You have eldritch blast and another cantrip and a single short rest spell slot. You have hex (and hopefully shield!) so you have a damage generator.  You have either +3 or +4 to charisma depending on the availability of volos eye, but you don't have ASI. You have light armor proficiency (useless with draconic for AC) so you can wear armor that gives good benefits (like Minthara's). You have 3 sorcery points and all your metamagic. You can cast 9 spells before long resting and you can font of magic your warlock slot (for 1 sorcery point ). You have access to hex, scorching ray and the circlet of fire(hopefully, and also partially available to 4S)\n\nDisadvantages: you only have 1 spell slot that refreshes on short rest. With only 2 level 2 spells slots you must be selective about what you use them on. You cannot realistically invest in spells like misty step to escape from bad spots. \n\n2S/2W advantages: you have access to agonizing blast, giving +4 damage (and ultimately a ~75% Avg damage increase) to EB. You also have access to repelling blast of you want it. You have 2 spell slots that refresh on short rest and 4 level 1 spell slots. You have twinned spell and extend spell. You can cast 10 spells per long rest which is the most of any of these combinations (FYI I'm not including sorcery points in this calculation). \n\nDisadvantages: all your spell slots are level 1.  You don't have quickened spell and you only have 2 sorcery points. You are far from your level 2 spell power spike but your cantrip damage is stronger than anyone. \n\n1S/3W advantages: you get a pact boon. You have 6 level 2 slots per long rest and 3 level 1 slots. You have agonizing blast which increases EB damage. You know 3 sorcerer spells\n\n Disadvantages You are the furthest from ASI because you won't be taking more Warlock levels. You don't have metamagic. You have a very narrow selection of spells and you have to be level 8 before you get level 3 spells for sorcerer. \n\n\nUltimately I think the strongest is 3S/1W. With access to EB you have good spell economy and you also have hex and scorching ray, a very powerful combination. You're closest to your next major power spike which is 3S/2W giving you agonizing blast, devil's sight and darkness from drow magic.  I think a close second is the 2/2 build because agonizing blast is just so good and you get the second warlock spell slot, something that really comes in handy when long rests are a limited resource. The problem is whether you'll be strong enough to pass the first power checkpoints without access to level 2 spells. Of course you'll have companions which make a huge difference. I think it also makes sense to have agonizing blast come online exactly when you get 2 rays of EB at level 5, where the power spike is immense.  Getting it earlier seems somewhat greedy because you miss out on some huge damage potential (9d6 scorching rays with hex!) thet you may need for really difficult early fights. \n\nLet me know what you think! I didn't go into spell selection to keep the length of this post reasonable but I would *love* to talk about it with someone interested.",

            "selftext": "I remember the first time I combined nails with boots in Divinity Original Sin II. Nails + Boots = Cleats (No slipping). That blew my mind! This was just one of dozens of examples of things you could craft, simply by combining random items.    \n\nThis was the system that made me feel like I was playing D&amp;D the most in DOS II. The reason being, it was random outside the box thinking, which led to a solution. It felt less like a video game mechanic and more like a tabletop problem solving event.    \n\nI don't recall collecting any sort of crafting recipe either like most games. It was just a random combination that resulted in a cool outcome. That is what D&amp;D is all about.   \n\nCurrently, in BG3, you can see the skeletal outline of this system, which can be used to craft a couple things (e.g. broken spear), however, it is bare bones in comparison to DOS II. This being EA, I understand and do not expect more than what we have. However, I really really hope they greatly expand upon what they have and incorporate skill checks into the equation.    \n\nRight now there are so many random things we can pick up in the world like candles, herbs, food, plants, rope, etc. And the ability to craft them into Potions, Poisons, Different types of Arrows, Cleats to reduce slipping, etc. Would be so awesome and fit right into the world of Baldurs Gate.    \n\nWhile the 5E rules may not line up exactly with some of these things, the freedom that comes with such a system, highlights the spirit of D&amp;D better than most mechanics I've seen before.    \n\nEdit: as an example, here are the craftable potions in DOS II versus BG3.    \n\nDOS II = 70+ CRAFTABLE POTIONS.   \n\nBG3 = 1 CRAFTABLE POTION.   \n\n\n\n\n I'm only sharing as a way of pointing out how varied it was in DOS II and lacking in BG3, which indicates to me that we can (hopefully) expect a much more robust system upon final release.   \n\nDOS II Crafting:    \n\n\nhttps://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Crafting      \n\n\nBG3 Crafting:    \n\n\nhttps://baldursgate3.wiki.fextralife.com/Recipes",

Why would I try super hard to kill the Hag before she turns invisible and retreats to her Lair? Or attack her before I know she's a hag? If you do that, you'll miss the cool confrontation with her down in her lair and dialogue. \n\nAnd then the other method. Why would I try super hard to sneak by these masked minions on my way to confront the hag? I guess you could make a guess by surmising since they're wearing masks, they're bring controlled. But then just knock them out? Why sneak? Meta gaming yet again, since you know it won't work correctly if you do that. Sneaking past them just doesn't feel right to me in that situation. \n\nAnd by sneaking past them, you're forced to make the fight even more difficult by now having to deal with the hag and her masked slaves at the same time. \n\nThe point about this quest I'm trying to discuss is this has been an issue since the beginning. Never been fixed after all the patches so far, and now we have only until release to see if it gets fixed and expanded on. \n\nMy question is why hasn't it been fixed during early access? It's in the EA area. If they did fix it, why would they not include it in the patches? For extra testing ensuring it works correctly. \n\nSince the dialogue is there for at least one of the masked slaves, saying they'll see you in Baldur's Gate. But currently, the only way to see it is so immersion breaking and meta-gamey that I just refuse to do it in its current state. \n\nMy worry is it'll still be buggy as it is in EA with how knocking out NPCs seem to be an afterthought, and they just disappear after a long rest due to insufficient testing. \n\nOr there is no plan to fix it. I can't really think of a good reason for them to consistently hold back in updating and fixing this specific quest other than purposefully witholding it so it's still new for us despite playing through EA. \n\nAre there any other reasons you can think of for withholding it? \n\nIt's the quest that bugs me the most currently in EA due to not being able to save them the simple way I want to: knocking them out and then returning to talk to them after defeating the hag. \n\nIt's like the simplest solution to a game that has quite a few little nuances to how you can solve problems, that it really bugs me aha",

Sometimes you can find hidden paths, caches of treasure, or even things that can aid in battles. \n\n4. Use storage containers at Camp. And sort things. Makes it way easier to find food, armor, miscellaneous items.\n\n5. Sometimes running straight into battle is the worst decision. Get the lay of the land and enemy movement/placement if you can.\n\n6. Explore. I can't emphasize this enough. Sometimes areas aren't out of bounds.

So, I'm not sure if he would hook up with a male character.\n\nI know that there is a possibility of a romance with Minthara if you decide to help the goblins conquer the Druid grove, and this can happen with both male and female characters.

            "selftext": "As we can see from the [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/), some notable minimum and recommended requirements for BG3 on PC are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Minimum|Recommended|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Processor (CPU)|Intel i5 4690  /  AMD FX 8350|Intel i7 8700k  / AMD R5 3600|\n|Graphics Card (GPU)|Nvidia GTX 970  /  AMD RX 480 (4+ GB VRAM)|Nvidia 2060 Super  / AMD RX 5700XT (8+GB VRAM)|\n|Memory (RAM)|8 GB|16 GB|\n\nThe 150 GB of storage space is also notable, but not the point of this post. The point of the post is to see if your PC can meet the requirements in the above table. This guide will include screenshots which will directly apply to those with a Windows 11 operating system. Other operating systems may have different interfaces for determining their PC's CPU, GPU, and RAM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1) On a Windows PC, hit ctrl+shift+esc to pull up task manager, and go to the \"Performance\" tab\n\n[Click on the icon shown by blue arrow to get to Performance tab. This window will look different on Windows 10 or other operating systems.](https://preview.redd.it/mrvde2jtam1b1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9f459fc455ad165d36b587c07baa79e17c87c19e)\n\nWindows 7 and 10 procedures for checking system specifications will very closely resemble those shown here. If you have a Mac or Linux or other operating system, you may need to look up what the procedures are for getting your CPU, GPU, and RAM info for your system.\n\n# 2) Record your computer's CPU\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Most CPUs in western markets are manufactured by AMD or Intel.](https://preview.redd.it/uxcebomvam1b1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=465b7a8ec4c7fe8d1f78127372d8b52a6915280d)\n\n# 3) Record your computer's GPU\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Most GPUs in western markets are manufactured by AMD, Nvidia, and to a lesser extent Intel. ](https://preview.redd.it/4lk1wonyam1b1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fbaecb8b5b21bfd03c15f34bf78c5adfd33ac36a)\n\nMany CPUs can also serve as a GPU. So some computers will have one GPU listed which is something generic like \"AMD Radeon Graphics\" or \"Intel UHD Graphics.\" On laptops that have two GPUs listed, this \"integrated GPU\" will be the GPU that is used when running on battery power. It uses less power than a discrete or separate graphics card, but also gives much less performance.\n\nOther computers will have CPUs which cannot function as a GPU. In this case, you'll see a GPU listed with a specific model number like the 6800 XT shown in the above image.\n\nAnd some computers will have a CPU with integrated graphics (a.k.a. your CPU can also serve as a GPU), as well as a separate graphics card as shown in the above image which shows GPU 0 (integrated graphics) and GPU 1 (discrete/separate graphics card). In which case you want to write down the graphics card that has the specific model number. If a laptop has two GPUs, this more powerful and separate GPU will be the one used while connected to wall power.\n\n# 4) Record your system Memory (RAM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This will usually be a number in even multiples of two (e.g. 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB)](https://preview.redd.it/qsli0ug0bm1b1.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ed3329aa6dcc116df4a2c21049f90260d3fe08c7)\n\n# 5) Compare your specs with the system requirements\n\nTo compare your system's CPU and GPU to the requirements, I recommend using reliable sites like CPUBenchmark/VideoCardBenchmark or TechPowerup to compare CPUs and GPUs. They aren't perfect and I'd say any of the comparisons in here have an application specific margin of error of about +/- 10%, but will give a decent starting point. I strongly, strongly discourage any use of UserBenchmark because they adjust their scores and written reviews in a very biased fashion against AMD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Comparison|Minimum|Recommended|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Processor (CPU)|[CPUBenchmark Link](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleCompare.php)|Intel i5 4690  /  AMD FX 8350|Intel i7 8700k  / AMD R5 3600|\n|Graphics Card (GPU)|[VideoCardBenchmark Link](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/singleCompare.php)|Nvidia GTX 970  /  AMD RX 480 (4+ GB VRAM)|Nvidia 2060 Super  / AMD RX 5700XT (8+GB VRAM)|\n|Memory (RAM)|Does your amount of RAM exceed the 8 GB minimum or 16 GB recommended?|8 GB|16 GB|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Using the above link for the CPU Comparison and adding my CPU (AMD 7600X) vs. the CPU I want to compare to (I used the i5-4690 which is one of the minimum CPU options from the store page) I get the following comparison...](https://preview.redd.it/1do85a03bm1b1.png?width=1205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e3fa28259ceef65e2816e54ec8e95a91a58efd3f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[...you can see that the 7600X has about 5x more performance than the i5-4690. The 7600X comfortably exceeds the minimum CPU requirements.](https://preview.redd.it/ibwri925bm1b1.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=91d476fe9bc656d1bffa6fc4c60a3c2d1c3de1d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can follow the same procedure above for CPU with the GPU using the [appropriate link](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/singleCompare.php). Below I show the minimum recommended GTX 970 as compared to my discrete graphics card (RX 6800 XT) and as compared to my \"integrated\" graphics (a.k.a. using my CPU, the R5 7600X, as a GPU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As can be seen here, my discrete graphics card (6800 XT) exceeds the minimum recommended GTX 970. But if I wanted to use my 7600X CPU as a GPU, I would struggle to run BG3.](https://preview.redd.it/mwo38r89bm1b1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6369de38271d6f302426803254c29d378b9515e7)\n\n# 6) What if you are below the minimum requirements?\n\n*Edit: Several comments regarding CPU under spec seem to indicate that you will very likely experience significant struggles if your CPU does not meet Larian's minimum requirements.*\n\nIf you are slightly below minimum performance then there is still a possibility that you may be able to run the game, but at significantly diminished graphics quality or framerates. I would strongly recommend against pre-ordering. Perhaps when the game fully releases, try purchasing at your preferred retailer with a refund policy (maybe a little after release in the event of post-launch patches), and determine whether the performance is acceptable.\n\nIf your CPU and memory (RAM) are more than sufficient but the GPU is not, then it is possible that graphics options such as DLSS or FSR will be able to give the graphics card the bump that it needs. These technologies allow the graphics card to render the games at a low resolution, and then use AI to upscale the image to a higher resolution. So the CPU and RAM can help make up for a lack of performance from the GPU, if the CPU and RAM have the capacity to spare. These technologies are significantly better than most other upscaling techniques, and both are implemented as options you can toggle in BG3. However I still would recommend waiting til after release if this is thee strategy you want to attempt.\n\nLastly, game streaming services such as GeForce Now work by having running the game on some company's hardware (in this case, Nvidia's) and then the video is streamed to your computer. This requires a reliable internet connection in order to play, limits modding capability, and requires you to pay a subscription if you want to play for more than an hour at a time. But it is an option many find more digestable than paying hundreds of dollars for a new console or upgrading their PC.",

More DRASTIC changes? \n\nI theorize that, due to the games delays and the coming of OneD&amp;D, that BG3's character creation menu will include features from other player's favorite books, such as Tasha's Origin feature and other subclasses from Xanathars. This will create a lot of variety with characters, and make it even more like modern DnD, plus it would give some playtest material for the tabletop version of OneD&amp;D.\n\nIf not when the game launches, I have a feeling these features may be added in DLC.",

Here's just some the choices off the top of my head:\n\n* All the different race/class combinations.\n* All the romance options, from beginning to end. Can you break off a romance and start another?\n* How the story plays out siding with the Absolute vs going against them.\n* Siding with the druids vs Goblins.\n* CAN you side with the Absolute without using any tadpole powers, and how far would you be able to go?\n* Would you be able to support the Absolute after saving Nere or others? In otherwords, can you pretend to support the Absolute, and how far could you take that fa\u00e7ade? \n* Taking various combinations of companions, how will they interact with each other during overworld exploration vs specific story elements? Maybe having a combination of certain party members will give you extra options for a mission, or disable certain decisions?\n* Is there a special ending for not using the tadpole powers AT ALL? A special ending for completely indulging in the tadpole powers? \n* The 3(?) different routes you can take from Act 1 to proceed to Act 2. Where do they lead, and how differently will those routes be depending on if you side with the druids vs goblins? Or maybe even being a specific race?\n* Then of course all the little people you help/hurt along the way. The little tiny interactions you have. Will they have some effect later on down the line?\n* The conversations you have with your team. How will your dialogue choices/persuasion attempts/failures impact the future? How about your reputation levels with them??\n\nAll of these and so much more that I'm just not thinking of right now.

The dialogue history shows \"Shadowheart is fixed on an old damaged statue\" or something like that but the cutscene nor sounds play. The only way it plays is if I approve the statue with JUST Shadowheart. But then, Tav doesn't have the option to ask her about it at all. She just gives me the basic dialogue and this particular detail isn't in the list of what I can say. It was working fine before and I haven't changed anything,except doing it later in the game than I usually do, but still before going into the goblin area.\n\nEdits:adding details that might help explain the issue better.",

            "selftext": "So just started out and have been playing the early fights a few different times at level 2 just to practice, and had some questions, 1 about spellcasting and one about melee fighting.\n\n1) So I took the advice to start with a barbarian so I could just focus on melee combat, but sure enough, picked up Shadowheart and Gale pretty early. Gale especially has so many spells right out of the gate, I have no idea what to focus on. Default had me taking like feather fall and some other utility skill, but in my mind I can't imagine when I'll use them (I'm sure they have uses, I just am dumb enough about the game atm not to be able to use them appropriately), and then most turns I have like 3-4 different damage options, and just end up randomly going for one.\n\nI know it's gonna take me a REALLY long time to learn the details of spellcasting, but for someone just starting out, is there any little piece of advice you can give me that would get me thinking in the right way? Trying my best to always read tooltips/combat log, to get a sense of things, but any advice is appreciated.\n\n2) As far as melee goes, so I have my barbarian, big STR/CON, and I understand rage seems to WANT me to be in battle. However, in general early on, it seems like range trumps pretty much everything so far. Especially when I can get the upper hand starting a fight, why would I ever want to be melee when I can hop on a hill and just snipe people with arrows? Because hit points in this game seem quite a bit lower than most games, it always seem like enemies closer to me can always pose a bigger threat to me than i do to them, so my party pretty much always tries to keep distance. I am correct in thinking \"tanking\" doesnt really exist in games like this, correct? I'm just trying to get a sense of how to engage in combat the best way, since hit and run doesnt seem to work with attacks of opportunity punishing me for disengaging.\n\nSorry for the very general questions, I know these are pretty big topics!",

So I am curious, especially when it comes to the combat in this game, is there such a thing as skill expression after you get past the initial stage of kind of learning the rules/mechanics? Obviously you need to learn stuff like how to try to get advantage on attacks and rolls, what skills/spells synergize, but i'm wondering in practice, is there opportunity to keep improving gameplay etc? I'm kind of wondering, for those who watch streamers etc, are there people that can wow you with gameplay....or is it not really that sort of game?\n\nHope that question makes sense",

Human, cleric of Bhaal. A young woman born in a family of cultists, her father was the city guard captain of a small Amn village. Her grandfather's family was tortured and slayed during the siege of Murann. Ogres and orcs slaughtered her grandpa's family and at that cost he managed to flee the siege. Swearing revenge for what he suffered, it was that *lucky* to meet a Bhaal cultists cell that managed to convey his anger into the practice and worship of *murder*. With Bhaal's dogmas is how he then raised his son, Callya's father. Settling up in a small village and working in the city guard, he eventually got promoted to lead it. When Callya was 18, she joined the guard too and also took the first steps to become a sworn priestess of Bhaal, following the murderous advice of the cell her family was in contact with. Callya grown up considering murder as a form of art and committed her first one before the Day's Farewell ritual, she washed her hands in a bowl of blood and proceeded to sacrifice the poor man that was abducted. There she felt for the first time the pleasure of committing homicide, she fell in a sort of trance and the cultists around her, sociopaths and not-so-smart hopeless people, considered that as a proof of divine intervention and started revered her as someone directly being under the influence of the God. From then on she would begin her path to become a cleric. Working as a city guard in a small village, it was also quite easy to find new sacrifices every ten day, be it arresting innocent people with false accuses, or even real criminals at times. Blood-hungry, if it wasn't a trivial tavern brawl in which she could slay a drunk or two, it was by planting false evidence and lead some innocent to the gallows. In any case, it was for Bhaal. Callya's intellectual and emotional horizons don't go any farther than her family teachings, the cultist cell chaotic efforts and Bhaal's dogmas. Growing rather aseptic and apathetic, murder and its ritual forms are the only things that excite her anyhow. One day, the cultist cell leader demanded for a unusual sacrifice; yet revered as a young priestess, she still had to prove herself and raise through the ranks, so for whatever reason in their contorted mind, they asked her to sacrifice her *cat*. There for the first time flickered a glimpse of moral compassion, and Callya refused to that, her pet being the only actual relationship she ever had outside the cult of Bhaal, and probably her only friend, if only had known the meaning of such a word. Things got tense with her family and the cell and at one point it was made clear she had no choice. Not knowing what to do, she decided to flee the village. She wandered for a while until someday, somehow, she was abducted. \n\n(Fun fact: I tried this concept in BG1 once. As per Bhaal's dogma you should murder someone at least every 10 day, so I started murdering NPCs in the wilderness of the first areas. The game then became totally unplayable as Flaming Fist officers would spawn every city transition, slaying my party. I'm actually excited to try this on BG3, as in roleplaying a Bhaal cultist and see where the game will bring her. It's a rather simple character with a banal story, I hypocritically put some *don't hurt animals* in a murderous sociopath for I just liked the dissonance, and it adds a bit of depth/possibilities also for future in-game interactions. Or even redemption, who knows. I actually wanted to roleplay a cleric of Cyric I used in many roleplay settings, but sadly we can't pick Cyric as divinity, and I like to follow what the game offers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Dynnara Do'Unna, Lolth-sworn monk from Menzoberranzan. Born in a minor house desperately willing to rise and win the Goddess favor, the family matron along with her sisters decided that Dynnara had no talent and was a threat and an obstacle, for they believed she could never gain Lolth's favor and decided to sacrifice her, hoping that the Spider Queen would notice their faithful acts. They sent her on a suicide mission in the Underdark, Dynnara being a young drow and newly sworn cleric, unaware of the plot behind her back and willing to show herself, went on cluelessly. She wandered a bit, the party she was with was slaughtered in a rather short time and at that point she decided to flee. That's when probably Lolth abandoned her and Dynnara lost her priestess powers. But it seems the Spider Queen decided not to take the sacrifice anyhow and Dynnara didn't die that day. Perhaps it was just a matter of time, like a trapped mouse, but somehow, with no spells and no equipment, she began to learn how to defend herself anew, with her bare hands. She reached the surface, leaving the treacherous Underdark behind. There she ended up being abducted in a rather short time, eventually ending up in a Illithid pod. Before the adventure begins, Dynnara understood she was sent to her own end by her family, despite losing her clerical feats, she still hasn't lost her faith in Lolth nonetheless, being sure she could regain her favor and take revenge over her mother and sisters. She's sure it's Lolth who saved her from her fate, and that the Spider Queen somewhere is amused watching the entertaining possibilities of her being still alive. Yet in a Illithid pod. \n\n(I'll probably go for this as a first run. I've always liked unusual choices, and a female drow monk surely is. I should probably go for warrior instead, but we'll see.)  \n\n\nI'm curious to read your stories and your characters!",

She wound up taking me behind the prison in the druid camp to the secret prisoner, down to some crypt where I was outnumbered like 12-4 and she used a bomb and wiped them lol, and definitely hard carried my fights.

At that point, all I could think was \"this is a fun Baldur's Gate mod for DOS2!\".  Quite frankly the makings of greatness were there, but it really kinda felt like fan-made jank.  \n\nWith all the updates and patches up until today though, this game has fully come into it's own.  Everything from new encounters, classes, level cap, and even the UI are leagues better than they were on my first run.  As a side note, I don't know if Larian made a special effort towards optimization or anything, but the current release runs way more smooth and looks way less ugly on my sub-optimal PC than it ever did at launch.    \n\nAs a fan of the series since BG1, I am comfortable in saying that this is so far worthy of the title of Baldur's Gate III.",

            "selftext": "Looking for guidance on what platform to buy for BG3. I\u2019m not a huge gamer but I love D+D and DOS2 on Switch and am unreasonably excited for this game. I have a PS4, Switch, and c. 2019 MacBook Pro\u2014 current plan has been to buy a PS5 to play the game, but I\u2019ve been reconsidering the more I think about it. I have no experience with PC gaming really, so I\u2019d appreciate any insight. Additional context: \n\n\u2014Graphics and frame rate aren\u2019t super important to me, but immersion is. I know I could probably run the game on my MacBook, but the performance will be distractingly bad. But I can still load up Witcher 3 on my PS4 in 2023 and think \u201cDamn that\u2019s a beautiful game.\u201d\n\n\u2014Value is also important to me. I\u2019ve planned to drop $500 for the PS5, and could see spending $100 or so more for a PC or Mac Mini, but for where I\u2019m at it\u2019s a big investment for one game. I\u2019d get further use out of all 3 options of course, but I don\u2019t know enough about gaming on a computer and want to avoid dropping $600+ for a mediocre experience. \n\n\u2014I think Larian did a pretty good job porting DOS2 to the Switch but I\u2019d be interested to hear from you folks in EA and longtime Larian fans: how much faith do we have in the UI updates for the controller? \n\n\u2014Reasons I\u2019m questioning the PS5 choice: UI and mouse vs. controller concerns, desire for mods, desire to preorder the game vs. concern it will be a bad port (I don\u2019t think it will be, I\u2019m just a worrier), Uncertainty around crossplay. \n\nDisclaimer: I know I\u2019m asking for speculation here and that there is still not a lot of information about console versions of the game yet.",

            "selftext": "I am a big fan of BG 1 and 2, bought them both when they came out. When news hit, that Larian will be doing BG3 I was thrilled, and still am. I preordered and dabbled a bit with the EA-Part of the game. Not too much, to avoid too many spoilers. Truth be told, I only once got through the Githyanki(?) ship to explore the EA, tried two more times but decided to wait for full release.\n\nUnfortunately, the opening sequence in a giant flying insect-like thing with slime-pools everywhere and strange creatures just feels like a different game alltogether. I don't get BG vibes from it. Its not like starting in a keep full of books and all the little daily issues the people there have, with a looming, dark story hanging over it.  Its also so different from Irenicus' dungeon and the quest to flee it. It just feels very weird to me. Brain-eating tadpoles don't seem to trigger my BG itch.\n\nOf course no one has seen the full city yet, and so I hope that there will be enough of these shady streets full of people with their own stories, dark corners and sewers with thugs ready to beat you up, different guilds with their own goals, companions with their own agenda, mysterious cemetaries, vibrant taverns and all the folks that give me as a player the feeling of being in a city that could have actually existed (at least in a fantasy setting) . I trust Larian very much, but I am also preparing myself for a little bit of nostalgia-disappointment.\n\ntldr; The opening scene feels not very BG-ish to me. I still think that BG3 will be an excellent game, hopefully with a great BG-vibe.",

I really want to play the hero as per most of my gaming experience so I was looking for ways to make oathbreaker work for me. As far as my browsing of other reddit threads goes, Oathbreakers can never be neutral or good. But that cobtradicts what this screenshot says. \n\n\"Though born of vile source, these powers can be used for good or ill.\" does that mean Larian Studios made Oathbreaker flexible for something like a Marvel's Punisher vibe? I'm confused. Does this mean I can still pursue a heroic playthrough as an Oathbreaker Paladin? Or am I mis understanding the alignment chart? I mean, I could misunderstand what good and evil actual mean so maybe evil doesn't necessarily mean selfish and destructive at all times? My only reference to this are the Pathfinder games where evil characters are actually cruel and selfish.",

(If you heal her later, she will go aggro on you, but you can circumvent that with the tactic below)\n\n2) A lot of people seem to have had problems with accidentally aggroing the gnome slaves during the fight with Nere. But in this fight, and in all similar fights, if you accidentally aggro an ally/neutral, then *do nothing more to upset them, and flee the fight*, when you return, you will be \"forgiven\" (albeit with an attitude of -40).

Shadowheart may or may not be in the party depending on what I learned about her in the first run.

Astarion killed.\n\n**Fourth playthrough:** Astarion as an origin character. He's a great fit for an evil playthrough and to experience his story in as much detail as possible.

I can easily media blackout for something.  For example, FF16, way too much information out there. I get why they have to market it like they do, but I don't want to know anything going in.\n\nBG3 on the other hand is still like a dream. I never thought in my wildest dreams we would see a sequel, have it be handled by a studio that cares so much about the IP, and is seemingly (judging this off EA) living up to the hype. \n\nNot that I've been waiting 20+ years for a sequel, but having it come after so long is amazing. The drip feed of info over the last few months has been excruciating after all the community updates we were receiving. At the same time, I don't want to know TOO much about the game. \n\nHow are you all feeling about this? I'll probably end up watching it all numerous times over since I have no self control with certain things, but I'll refrain from watching deep dives, because I've already ruined a couple potential big moments by seeing those types of videos. \n\nAnyhow, have a great day!

            "selftext": "Hi all, this is a new player question from one who loves modern western RPG but just jumping into BG3.  I\u2019ve also given Divinity Original Sin 2 a try, only on Fort Joy. \n\nThe part where I struggle with is not knowing whether I have completed that particular area before moving on, or not knowing how much farther in is the crypt going to go before I have to go back to camp, or always being not sure what to do. \n\nIt\u2019s just giving me anxiety.  This does not happen with modern western RPG, because I know that devs would not create a quest that would be overly long or overtly extensive without an appropriate break. (For example, I knew that if I undertook that Mission in Mass Effect, it would not go on and on indefinitely, it would probably wrap up in about 20-25 minutes, and every nook and cranny can be completed fully and surely). \n\nI struggle with that in here because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve missed, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m at the right place, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m struggling because I\u2019m not supposed to be at this cave at this level , and whether staying here and struggling is futile or whether I should move on. In the end, I just kept googling everything and I couldn\u2019t move on - passed by a trapdoor that I couldn\u2019t open, passed by a vine i couldnt interact with - \u201cgoogle - am i supposed to interact with this door at level 2\u201d etc, just anxiety all around. Everything I passed on, I felt like I made a mistake. I\u2019m even contemplating of writing on a notebook all the things I passed by that I probably need to come back to. In contrast, in games like Mass Effect, I knew I was exactly where I had to be and even if I died, it means I have to try again - but thats fine because I knew I had to be there. \n\nAny advice on how to change the mindset to feel less anxious about this?  Or is this just a sign that this type of genre is not for me, and that I require RPG on guardrails?",

Kill it!\" and no spell slot used.\n\nPact of the Tome for Thaumaturgy over Friends, Thorn Whip for the pull and Light could be replace with whatever. Not sure if Shillelagh is useful since you'll be blasting. Vicious Mockery could be taken just for the laughs.\n\nASI will get you to 20 CHA with early access items.\n\nBook of Ancient Secrets for the utility and no spell slots used. Depending on release Detect Magic could be changed to Identify or Purify Food and Drink whichever is better and available.\n\nElemental Adept for Fire Damage Boost.\n\nSpell Sniper for the Spell Range increase.\n\nSpells that don't deal damage are just filler for situational uses and control. When in doubt blast them out!\n\nOtherworldly Leap for maneuverability or can be swapped out. One with shadows looks good but invisibility once per long rest when you can literally just nuke everything seems like a waste.\n\nThis build has a lot of utility spells that don't use slots to get the most out of your playthrough plus lots of damage as a face character.

            "selftext": "TL:DR at the bottom. Sorry\n\nfor context, I already know that versatile weapons only scale with whichever is higher. I also know that most range spells scale with dexterity for accuracy. I'm just wondering if there's benefit to having both or if I'll be wasting attribute points by doing so.\n\nI've played the Early Access from start to finish albeit with a few missions missed along the way. I've already understood the applications for each attributes like wisdom being useful for saving throws. When the game's finally released, I'd love to play with my friends but I'm giving them full cobtrol of our stories so I can build a combat-focused character for once instead of a a role-play one. \n\nMy idea is to build a rogue with 14 in strength and 16 in dexterity. \n\nI want high strength for these reasons\n- jump scales with strength\n- shove effectivity and resistance scales with strength\n- the ability to pick up and carry barrels is also strength\n\nAs for dexterity, I just want to be proficient in \n- sleight of hand\n- range combat\n\nThe problem: \nPutting points in both str and dex means less points for constitution and wisdom. Knowing my friends, they'd olay the game on highest difficulty and I don't want to be dying on the first turn or getting locked un hold person. \n\nThus, my conclusion so far is to choose one of either (strength or dexterity) and prioritise the other two, (constitution and wisdom). I came here to ask if there is ever any merit to forgoing one of the two saving throws in exchange for having both of the first two attributes.\n\nTL:DR\n\nI want to make a character with high STR and DEX but don't want to sacrifice either CON and WIS. Should I sacrifice CON or WIS so I can have high STR and DEX for the sake of having more offensive options and utility as a rogue? Or will that guarantee a terribile experience in combat?",

Due to it only working for heavy weapons(Strength based), it won't work for a dex focused barbarian. So unless he's going to be a strength of hill giant potion addict(which I'll admit sounds humorous), don't think this'll work.\n\n**+2 Con**:\n\n+1 hp/lvl and +1 AC\n\n**+2 Dex**:\n\n+1 att roll and +1 AC",

Walking death star.\n\n\nAstarian will go thief rogue 3 for the extra bonus actions to have 3 attacks. Then a full 5 levels of hunter ranger. He'll get 1d8/per round extra damage, two weapon fighting fighting style and hunters mark on every attack. Then the rest back into rogue.\n\nLaezel will multiclass barbarian at level 2 to try to get to berserker at level 4. It will technically grant extra attack 1 level earlier. She'll pick up great weapon master at 5 and extra attack at 6. Then back to fighter until level 8. The battle master dice add utility and an easily accessible reaction attack. \n\nKarlach will go straight 5 levels of barbarian if that's what she starts as. Every where I've looked seems to point at this being the case. Her build will be identical to Laezels in terms of progression and theory.\n\nTav will focus on constitution and charisma.

The problem I have with them is that as a group, their interactions are really unimpressive. I see so many people talk about how they're a group of misfits who have to learn to work together, that their intense personalities make it interesting to see them together, but right now none of that promise is demonstrated.\n\nAside from Lae'zel and Shadowheart, there's really no interesting interactions between the companions. They don't really talk to each other, and the party banter they have out in the world is predictable and doesn't add depth to them or their relationships. They don't even really clash that much. There are no strong reactions to the reveal of Astarion being a vampire or Shadowheart worshipping Shar. And if you ask me, that makes them feel shallow. They're not fleshed out people, they're just there for us to interact with and have no existence outside of their interactions with us.\n\nWhat does everyone else think of this?",

(Yeah they are in a culture where they eat elf and dwarf meat.  I still want to take them with me).\n\n(charm and suggestion won't work on the kids.  They still escape instead of staying and hiding, or helping, like other goblins have).\n\n4) Or leave Halsin to free himself...  which makes no sense because it's the parties prime directive.\n\nMy bard wants to see this end in a glorious, tale spinning battle over Emerald Grove so the plan is not to assassinate the Drow True Soul but let her lead the army to the Grove. My bard is confident of the outcome and the goblins, infected with the Absolute's philosophy, deserve a death in a glorious battle.  \n\nDoes killing Halsin make for an interesting, tragic tale for my bard?  \n\nWhich path to choose?\n\nI just wanted to take these 2 goblin kids with me and have the druids raise them.",

I discovered and played DOS2 in October of last year and put over 100 hours into it. I looked for more games by Larian because I enjoyed it so much, and saw they were developing Baldurs Gate 3 (my first time hearing about it) and that it was in early access.\n\nHowever at this point, a release date had yet to be announced and there was no information on a console release (I have a PS5, would love a PC some day \ud83e\udd72), so I didn\u2019t even bother looking into the game too much as I didn\u2019t want to get super excited about a game I likely wouldn\u2019t be able to play. \n\nThen a little while ago I saw that it would be on PS5 on release and was very intrigued, so I decided to look into it more. Since then I have been SUPER hype for this game and it is my most anticipated release in a very long time, and will probably be the first game in years i pre-order. \n\nDespite my interest, I know next to nothing about the story of Baldurs Gate and the world it\u2019s set in. I have no experience with Table Top gaming and DnD, so the lore of the Forgotten Realms is pretty much a mystery to me. \n\nDoes anyone have any good resources for a beginner looking to learn more about this universe (outside of playing the other games)? especially something that gives a good overview/summary of the world(s) and not necessarily just stuff that is relevant to BG3s story.

And they stack. So lets say the attacker hit you, they get Reeling for 3 turns. Then, they miss, it get go back to 3 turn, etc etc. I've soloed the game easily but stacking it, making my characters invincible and the ennemies unable to hit me because they were at 50 reeling\n\nHope they change it !",

That said, is there anyway for me to get the dice skin without the rest of the deluxe content.\n\nI'd really like the skin (not in an obsessive way, I could live without it it would just be neat) but it feels like a waste to use the digital content on my copy if 95% of the content I already have.\n\nIn realize people may not know the answer to this, but thought I'd ask in case I missed something (like the digital stuff all being separated to different codes rather than 1 code for all).",

            "selftext": "So I've encountered a problem with Scratch.\n\nI've just met it, and after some peregrinations I could find it when I finally got back to the camp. However, he kept initiating fights - prompting -5 attitude upon arrival.\n\nI had no pets or familiar nor any reason to have it dislike me, as per indicated in various topics already debating the subject. However, since I had the talkative skeleton in the camp, I couldn't end the fight properly. I managed, by sneaking, to end the fight using only non-lethal options, however both Volo and the dog were gone. Hitting the brave boy (and I don't mean Volo) was painful enough, but having it leave the camp - even rightfully - was not acceptable for me. Thankfully, I quicksave quite often (it's early access, after all), therefore I had a save right before going back to camp so I could try absolutely everything I could find online, and trying other things of my own.\n\nSo, if it ever happens to you,  the best solution I could find goes as follow:\n\n\u2022 Separate the group.\n\n\u2022 Send a character (Shadowheart in my case) alone, without the rest of the group, via an access point (not the \"long rest\").\n\n\u2022 Letting her being beat up by the entire camp.\n\n\u2022 Once they had their full of gratuitous violence, they go back to their respective spots, yellowed again. The attitude of Scratch towards Shadowheart (in my case) is lowered by 25.\n\n\u2022 Rejoin her and thank her for the sacrifice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently they just all needed to let off some steam or whatever, because they're all there and seem rather relaxed. I could blissfully pet Scratch for the first time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Still a good boy.](https://preview.redd.it/v1kt713abh7b1.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c34810f22db39be9c69a44835fb72bb267c9f05)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps !

The ability to select deities that your character worships especially allowing warlocks to choose their patron based on their subclass.\n\n4.ive said this already but I really want a manual stat roll system in the game or you can stick with the point buy system if you want,however if it comes to multi-player have it only be point buy.\n\n5. More Feats in the game(which I'm sure it'll be there but maybe ones that are exclusive to this game only is what I mean aside from those)\n\n6. Possible a confirmed level cap of 15 max though a lot of people would like lower which I'm fine with either tbh maybe at most 13\n\n7. Multiclass of course\n\n8. All the subclasses plus some new ones(like 3 new ones possibly)\n\n9. More background options.those that currently exist in game and any added ones have dialouge choices that can use for more dialouge variety as well outside of things you do which give you inspiration.(idk I would like to see them come into play in dialouge as well like the option showing on their labeled whatever your background is so you know what it is coming from)\n\n10.

Therefore, the September 6th release date won't make much of a difference to them.\n\nHere's the Patch Note on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3657534571513526776?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/3657534571513526776?l=english)\n\nWe've expressed our thoughts on these updates, as well as the newly added races and classes, in a video that we created.

As it is, one route would be to have her do a few levels of Fighter to add armor/weapon proficiencies and make her better in melee. Alternatively, have her take a few levels of Gloom Stalker ranger feels consistent with one take on the character story. Not sure I'm wild about either for narrative/story/lore reasons.  \n* Wyll - I find myself wanting to give him a couple levels of Swords Bard, just because he's so preening and self-promoting. It's an impulse I'll probably resist, tho. Bards are about making everyone else around them better. That doesn't feel much like Wyll. \n* Astarion - I mean, if anyone was crying out to be a Gloom Stalker, it's this cat. And he has the stats. If he had the strength I could tell a story about his character arc that fits with a few levels of Vengeance Paladin. He has the WIS for any cleric subclass, but I just don't see faith and devotion in his deck of cards. \n* Gale | Lae'zel - Can't see any multi-class here, really.

There have been several times where I've Dashed up to an enemy and had to wait until the next turn to attack. With this I can dash forward and make a weapon attack using my bonus action, AND gain a +5 to the damage roll OR perform a boosted shove.\n* Alert sounds great. +5 to initiative permanently + can't be surprised.\n* Elemental Adept sounds good. Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.\n* Lucky sounds good. Get 3 Luck dice you can use at will. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. Can also use on attack rolls made against you.\n* Mage Slayer sounds good. There are a lot of enemy casters in EA.\n* Ritual Caster\n* Sentinel sounds awesome. You can make your Paladin a true protector. Especially in higher difficulties since the enemies will prioritize your weaker party members.\n* Savage Attacker allows you to reroll your damage dice, and you can choose either total.\n* War Caster sounds amazing! In fact, in my dnd campaign I'm currently using it for my warlock. It sounds really good to use for a pact of the blade warlock who intends on being in the thick of things, allowing you to cast a spell as an opportunity attack. \n* Observant. You have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.\n\nI think we now have feats that cover all stats to give a +1. Now you can build your character with a 15 in a stat and be able to take a feat to give it that nice round number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always liked choosing a Feat instead of an ASI, even in my normal DND campaigns. It's just fun having extra abilities, bonuses to things here and there, new spells, making certain actions more powerful, etc.\n\nI know ASI is usually seen as the most powerful option, but some of these go really well with certain classes or other combinations. An easy one is Alert with an Assassin. Assassins get advantage on any creature that hasn't taken a turn yet. +5 to imitative + can't be surprised means you should 99.9% of the time be able to hit pretty much whoever you want at the start of combat.

My thoughts:\n\nLae'Zel: Eldritch Knight for sure; she's a Gith, and they're known for psionic powers.\n\nAstarion: Bloodthirsty vampire just screams Assassin to me, though their pnp features don't seem like they'd translate well to a video game. I'm assuming Larian homebrews something useful; if not, I suppose Arcane Trickster's magic fits a vampire thematically a bit.\n\nGale: I'm actually not sure which school would fit him best. Interested to hear what other people say.\n\nKarlach: Definitely seems like a Berserker. The community update said she's \"a beast in battle, but if she gets too worked up, she'll destroy anything she touches - including you.\"\n\nMinsc: Gloomstalker will probably be best if we end up spending a lot of time in the Underdark, but I think Beastmaster is most fitting, if his animal companion can actually be Boo, who can actually go for the eyes.\n\nJaheira: She was a multiclass fighter-druid in BG1-2, so I'd lean towards Spores. My understanding (though I've never played as a Druid, so correct me if I'm wrong) is that Land is focused on casting, while Spores synergize better with a melee attacker. That sounds more her style. \n\nHalsin: Moon, for sure. The guy talks about shapeshifting all the time, so of course he'll be in the shapeshifting subclass.",

I have decided that I will learn the Lore **directly playing BG3** and asking **Chat Gpt** every information i want to know, but what's the **cool** thing?

            "selftext": "So a bit of a speculation about who the seventh origin companion could be. On the Panel from Hell webpage ([https://panelfromhell.baldursgate3.game/](https://panelfromhell.baldursgate3.game/)) there's an opening to the right where we see a shadow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis shadow figure, I believe, is the seventh companion which will be revealed on Friday. I noticed the character looks to be wearing a hood and to be slightly of the shorter size. Since we don't have any short race companions yet, I believe it's likely this character is a halfling, a gnome or a dwarf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis character is seen as a shadow on the webpage and I think it also might be a hint to the character's class. The character does its work from the shadows so to speak. Fitting classes could in that case be the monk (shadow subclass), the rogue (assassin subclass) and the ranger (gloom stalker subclass).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the rogue, that class is already represented in the form of Astarion. Hence I don't think it will be a rogue. That leaves us with the monk and the ranger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then looked at the Magic the gathering set called Commander legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate ([https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-image-gallery/commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-image-gallery/commander-legends-battle-for-baldurs-gate)) which includes a lot of cards of well known/famous characters from the Baldur's Gate series (including BG3). In that list of cards I find two characters, who sort of fits what I'm looking for according to the parameters above, and that is the monk Oji and the ranger (gloom stalker) Erinis. Both of these are listed as \"legendary creatures\", which is the same title as other well known characters from the BG-series have, for example Minsc and Jan Jansen but also newer characters from BG3 like Karlach and Astarion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the cards you can see that Oji is a human and Erinis is a halfling. Looking at Erinis card, you can also see she's wearing a hood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my guess is that the seventh companion will be Erinis, a halfling gloom stalker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does the rest of you think? I'd love to hear more speculations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Small sidenote: There have been datamining mentioning a halfling druid character who seemingly later got cut. This character could be viable again, albeit in another alteration, most likely a different class than first intended. This character could be in play too, but I'm sticking with the theory put forth above.)",

            "selftext": "I have a few questions regarding ranged / non-ranged spells in combat\n\n1. As far as I understand it, in D&amp;D 5e *only* ranged ***attack*** spells (i.e. those that require an ***attack roll***)  are cast at disadvantage if the caster is within 5 feet (2m?) of an enemy:   [dnd 5e - Disadvantage on Range Attack Spell vs Range Spells? - Role-playing Games Stack Exchange](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/46823/disadvantage-on-range-attack-spell-vs-range-spells)  - **so  there's no penalty to casting non-attack ranged spells (e.g.**  [**Hold Person**](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:hold-person)**)** **within reach of an enemy.**  Does BG3 also work the same way?\n2. For ranged *weapon* attacks (e.g. crossbows), there are two range limits - normal and long. If you shoot at an enemy at the longer range, the roll is at disadvantage. **For ranged** ***spell*** **attacks, I don't think this applies?** i.e. if the range of the spell can reach the target, it is unaffected by long distance (if cast more than  5 feet from any enemy), right? So a full Drow (which has Superior Darkvision out to 120 feet) can cast ranged attack spells in the dark (I don't mean the Darkness spell) up to their maximum ranged without disadvantage (assuming no other sources of disadvantage)?\n3. Which n*on-ranged* **attack spells** (i.e those that require an attack roll)  are available to Bards (up to level 10) and level 1 Sorcerers?  I think it's just the level 1 Sorcerer spell [Shocking Grasp](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shocking-grasp), which isn't amazing (just 1d8 dmg), but does scale-up by 1d8 dmg at  levels 5 and 11 (though is that *character* or *caster* level?) and gives you advantage on the attack if the target is wearing metal armour. \n\n**TL; DR**: In melee it sounds like you can cast *touch* attack spells (i.e. those that require an attack roll)  and ALL non-attack spells (i.e. those that **don't** require an attack roll, even if ranged) in melee without disadvantage and ranged attack spells are unaffected by long range, as long as cast within their maximum range and cast more than 5 feet away from any enemey, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

IN BG3, from what I heard, you can't really change the class of your origin character....is it true? And so, if you wanna experience part of the story....are you forced to play a specific class tied to that specific origin?\n\nI know they added a custom origin character who lost his memory and that is MANDATORY (IMO) for first playthrough...but what about the others?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

            "selftext": "# UPDATE: Larian made major Rule Changes\n\nThe builds and guide below have been slightly modified to account for some rule changes Larian has made to multiclassing revealed in [Italian written article](https://multiplayer.it/articoli/baldurs-gate-3-intervistata-lead-system-designer-larian.html) or [Enlgish translated article](https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3Builds/comments/14w4cgp/comment/jrg11c5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n1. They have removed ability score requirements for multiclassing. This is the 13 in different stats that you need in order to multiclass. This change definitely makes multiclassing more accessible and could buff many builds, but few would say it is game breakingly overpowered. I tried to edit out previous mentions of ability score requirements.\n\n2. I am not really sure what to make of this line, but it sounds like it is going to buff multiclassed casters:\n\n&gt; The other thing we changed is how magic users use spell slots, making it less punishing to level up more than one magic class. One of the issues with multiclassing is that if you multiclass early in the game, you don't get strong abilities like \"Fireball\" at the same level as a \"pure\" class. But we wanted players to be able to multiclass from the beginning of the campaign, without necessarily having to wait for higher levels, so we had to tweak the resource usage a bit\n\nUntil we get clarification on what point 2 means, I am not going to account for it. It could significantly change anything with regards to multiclassing casters. I still think the below guidance can be immensely beneficial for understanding how multiclassing works, and then you can apply the modifications to your build based off the above rule changes.\n\n# Introduction and Assumptions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I added this to the [FAQ on the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14l8ec8/baldurs_gate_3_early_access_faq_with_sources/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1) section about multiclassing, so if those who frequent the sub see posts asking  about multiclassing **broadly** then you may want to shoot them to the bottom of the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14l8ec8/baldurs_gate_3_early_access_faq_with_sources/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1).\n2. I also made r/BG3Builds years ago before this sub had a working flair system and when moderation was a bit lackluster. With the slow addition of Early Access features, uncertainty on full release features, and improvement of this subreddit including more moderation, this caused the BG3Builds sub to become neglected by me. Now that we have more certainty on release features and character options, I'll be updating the sub r/BG3Builds over the next week or so. This sub is great, I just feel that r/BG3Builds can provide a more focused discussion on builds for those interested and I feel the discussion is warranted given the differences between D&amp;D 5e and BG3.\n3. The D&amp;D 5e rules for multiclassing can be found [here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Multiclassing) for free. Larian may adjust these rules in BG3. Larian is already homebrewing several of the rules regarding race, class, and subclass options. Some D&amp;D 5e builds may not work well in BG3. And BG3 may have some really good multiclassing builds that wouldn't be possible in tabletop. Until we know the exact details and to get people a basic understanding of the rules, I am going to assume that BG3 will be in line with D&amp;D 5e except in areas we already know this will not be the case.\n4. There are many posts out there with regards to D&amp;D 5e multiclassing. This post will be unique in that it will account for the subclasses, races, and level cap which are found in BG3. But once again, we don't know all the details yet to plan a complete character builder, so I am treating any unknown features as though they work like in D&amp;D 5e.\n5. You can try to make your own D&amp;D 5e multiclassed character using character creators like those on D&amp;DBeyond. A free account I believe gets you 2 or 3 characters you can make at a time, and you will be very limited on what class, race, and subclass options you can pick. But you can dabble in multiclassing, pull up a character sheet for the character you made, and see how things work.\n6. Edit to add [this video by Mortismal Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIzafqErqM) which closely aligns with this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Opportunity Cost\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is difficult to \"mess up\" a D&amp;D 5e character, but Multiclassing without a plan can be one way to do so. Multiclassing does not come for free. Every level you take in some other class, means one less level in your main class. It's up to you to weigh whether the trade-off is worth it. For example, in the first of the below builds the character will finish at Barbarian 9/Fighter 3. Those 3 levels in fighter grant some great features, and many people would say it's worth the multiclass. But is it worth losing the subclass feature, feat/ability score increase, and relentless rage that a barbarian gets between levels 10-12 in their main class? That's for you to decide. If you are going to multiclass, then do it with a plan in mind and always weigh the opportunity cost.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that multiclassing can result in you losing a feat/ASI. Most classes only get feats/ASIs every 4 levels (fighters or rogues can get additional ones at 6th or 10th class level respectively). Missing out on one or more of these can be extremely detrimental to your character at higher levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Common Multiclassing Confusion and Pitfalls\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will not cover all the multiclassing rules. They are described in depth [here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Multiclassing) with examples. The basics are that when you level up you can choose to increase the level in your existing class. Or you can take a level in a different class. So a second level character may be a Level 1 Fighter/Level 1 Wizard, getting *most* of the benefits of each class. But I will provide emphasis to some common sources of confusion and pitfalls.\n\n**What do you get from your second class?** - You get *almost* everything that your second class has to offer. The biggest outliers are the starting proficiencies. You do not get any additional saving throw proficiencies by taking first level in a second class. You only get armor, skill, and weapon proficiencies from your second class that are shown in the [table found in the rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Proficiencies). If your second class has a subclass which grants proficiencies at first level, then you DO get those subclass proficiencies. \n\nThe other big things that you do NOT get to stack from a multiclass are [unarmored defense, extra attack, and uses of channel divinity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#ClassFeatures).  A 5th level paladin gets to make an extra attack when they take the attack action, and a 5th level barbarian gets to make an extra attack when they take the attack action. But a barbarian 5/paladin 5 does NOT get three attacks when they take the attack action (barring some external buff of some kind). Monk and barbarian unarmored defense do NOT stack, you get one or the other.\n\n**Class Level vs. Character Level vs. Spellcaster level -** For the most part if you are trying to see what your character can or cannot do, you need to only look at the features granted by their level in each of their classes. The two main things that scale off Character Level are [proficiency bonus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#ProficiencyBonus) and damage scaling from cantrips (0 level spells). There are other things that scale of character level, such as the Tough feat. But we are really getting into nuances here. Cantrip damage scaling and proficiency bonus are the big two. Spellcaster level is covered below.\n\n**Multiclassing Spellcasters (ignoring Warlocks) -** Multiclassing spellcasters is the most complicated part. You determine your spells known/prepared (including cantrips) by looking at what spells you would know or prepare for each class with the Spellcasting feature. *And you must use the spellcasting ability (Cha, Int, Wis) for the class which gave you that spell.*\n\nHowever to determine the number of spell SLOTS you must determine your spellcaster level, and then [use the caster level table provided in the rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#MulticlassSpellcaster) (which is identical to the spell slot table for any full caster). So while a second level sorc would only have three spell slots of 1st level, and a third level paladin would only have three spell slots of 1st level, a sorc 2/paladin 3 does NOT have six spell slots of 1st level. This character's spellcaster level would be third. 2 spellcaster levels from sorc, and only 1 spellcaster level from paladin since paladins are \"half-casters\" (like rangers), so you divide the class level by two and then round down to determine the spellcaster level. This means the character would have three first level spell slots, and a second level spell slot. But they won't actually know any second level spells, meaning that the second level spell slot can only be used to upcast the first level spells that they actually know.\n\nWhile the basic rules version of multiclassing don't cover Eldritch Knight Fighter and Aracne Trickster Rogue, they follow the same rules as paladins and rangers except that EK fighter and AT rogues are 1/3 casters. Meaning you need to divide their level by 3 and then round down to get their effective spellcaster level.\n\n**Multiclassing Warlock with other casters -** Note that warlocks do not have the Spellcasting feature. They have Pact Magic. Pact Magic and Spellcasting are separate. [The warlock spell slots are in addition to whatever spell slots you have from your effective caster level](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Spellcasting) as described above. When you take a short rest, you only get your warlock spell slots back (not counting something like Wizard's Arcane Recovery feature). However the warlock spells slots are interchangeable with spell slots used to cast spells from other classes, or class abilities like divine smite.\n\n**Spellcasting abilities (Cha, Int, Wis)** - Didn't I already bring this up in italics in the \"Spellcasters\" section? Yes. But it is so important that I'm going into it with more depth. If somebody shows you a high elf character with levels in Sorc X/Druid Y, but don't see 2 reasons why this would possibly be a bad idea then keep reading. Any spells you learn from being a sorc use Cha for determining the chance to hit, or the target's ability to resist the effects. Similarly, any spells you learn from being a Druid will use Wis for determining the chance to hit, or the target's ability to resist the effects. Multiclassing between these two classes is possible, but you have to be careful about it. You either need to roll for stats (still pending verification that this will be an option in BG3) and get really good Cha and Wis scores to be able to use all Sorc and Druid spells effectively. Or you focus on one of these spellcasting stats (Wis or Cha). If you pick Wis, then you can choose whatever Druid spells you want, and just make sure you only pick Sorc spells that don't require dice rolls to hit or save, such as buffs like mirror image or jump. Vice versa if you pick Cha as your main casting stat, you will need to be careful about what Druid spells you pick. \n\nI picked high elf for this hypothetical character, because as part of picking this race they get a cantrip that scales off Int and a lot of people miss this detail, wondering why their sorc is using Int to cast ray of frost. Similarly, a drow's Faerie Fire scales off Cha. Always look at what the casting stat is for a racial spell, and if it requires an attack roll or saving throw.\n\n**Making a spellsword or \"gish\" character** - BG3 does not include the Hexblade class, which is overtuned at first level and has become a staple of \"gish\" builds. This is because the hexblade subclass allows you to use Cha as both your spellcasting ability and your ability to determine accuracy and damage with weapon attacks. BG3 also does not seem to include the \"SCAG\" cantrips of booming blade or green flame blade. These spells help casters that don't have extra attack keep up in melee combat with martial characters that do have extra attack. It is a bit trickier to make gish characters without these options, but still doable. Single class options exist such as eldritch knight fighter, arcane trickster rogue, ranger, paladin, warlock (pact of the blade at level 3, thirsting blade at level 5), swords bard, valor bard. But if you want to make a multiclassed gish, then you will want to get to extra attack as soon as you can. Ideally level 5, though level 6 is doable. If you are at level 7 and playing in melee without extra attack or the SCAG cantrips, you're going to have a bad time.\n\n**Multiclassing martials -** Multiclassing martials is pretty simple, once you understand that [extra attack from different classes do NOT stack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#ClassFeatures). But similar to above with gish characters, you want to get to extra attack as fast as possible. You can afford to perhaps take a dip outside of your main class. But you absolutely want to have extra attack by the time you are level 7 as a martial character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Popular &amp; Likely Viable BG3 Multiclass Builds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe below are common multiclass builds in D&amp;D 5e which may work in BG3. I also added a couple builds that may work better in BG3 than they do in tabletop. These are by no means the only possible multiclass builds. There are tons and tons of them, and I myself am considering making my first character a paladin/rogue multiclass which I won't cover here since it isn't what folks would view as common or particularly synergistic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Crit Fishing Half Orc - Barbarian 9/Champion Fighter 3**\n\nWhen a half-orc crits, they roll an extra damage die. When a 9th level barbarian crits, they roll an extra damage die. Champion fighters have double the crit chance (they crit on a 19 or 20 on the attack roll). And if a barbarian reckless attacks, you get advantage on the attack roll which further increases your odds of getting a crit (but also makes you a bit more vulnerable). If you want to go this route, make sure you use a two-handed weapon with a d12 damage die unless you find something extraordinary for your build. If you use something like a greatsword with a 2d6 damage die, then your extra damage dice from half-orc and barbarian would bring it up to 6d6 damage (average 21) on a crit. Whereas is you use a weapon like a battleaxe with a d12 damage die and crit then you will do 4d12 damage (average 26) on a crit. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tanky Moon Druid - Moon Druid X/Barbarian Y**\n\nMoon druids can wildshape, and when they do they basically get a massive HP pool on top of their existing one. Barbarians can also rage, and while raged take only half damage from physical damage (the most common type). With Totem (a.k.a. Wildheart) of the Bear, then this rage damage resistance expands to instead half ALL damage except psychic. If using bear totem then I think the best split is Druid 9/Barbarian 3. But you could argue for other splits as well. One common point of confusion is that people think unarmored defense carries over into wildshape. Technically you only get the \"natural armor\" of your wildshaped form, and do not get any bonus to your AC from your barbarian unarmored defense. Some DMs let players use unarmored defense in place of the wildshpaed form's natural armor if unarmored defense is higher, but note that your dex and con change to that of the creature you are wildshaped into. Under no circumstance should unarmored defense stack with wildshaped natural armor. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tanky Caster version 1 - Fighter X/Squishy Caster Y**\n\nThe \"squishy caster\" in this scenario is usually a Wizard. It also works with lore bards, warlocks, and sorcerers, but these classes will often do a similar build where they choose paladin instead of fighter as will be discussed below. By taking your first level in fighter you get proficiency in (among other things) medium armor, shields, and con save proficiency which is great for maintaining concentrations on spells. As well as a fighting style, and defense is a great option for this. Plus second wind for a bit of self-healing. By making your caster start as a fighter with 14 dex you'll have medium armor, a shield, and the defense fighting style for a total of 19 AC. Or you can start at 13 Str and go the heavy armor route with chain mail. Or you can go 15 Str and go the heavy armor route, and get 21 AC with plate mail, a a shield, and defense fighting style. This is enough to get from the fighter class for some people, but others will take a second level in fighter at some point (maybe character level 3) for Action Surge. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tanky Caster version 2 - Cleric 1/Wizard 11**\n\nI guess this works on other squishy casters like sorc or bard or warlock, but I never hear people talk about doing this on anything but wizard. So I'll just specify wizard on this one. This build is taken for similar reasons as the above Tanky Caster version 1 build; provide armor class to a squishy caster. The downsides are that you don't get the defense fighting style, second wind, or the option to get action surge. What you DO get is another level in a full caster class, which fighter does not provide. This benefit may increase the number and level of spell slots you have through the early and middle stages of the game. But 11th level and 12th level caster have the same number of spell slots so it does not make a difference near the end of the game. You also get the spells known from a cleric. This includes great spells that don't require you to make any attack rolls or force saves, such as guidance or bless. So having the bare minimum 13 Wis is fine. And while healing word from the cleric does scale the healing slightly off of your Wis modifier, the amount healed is not really relevant when restoring an unconscious ally to life in the middle of combat. Lastly, you get the level 1 cleric subclass benefits. Many will pick a subclass that grants heavy armor proficiency such as life, nature, tempest, or war. I personally encourage knowledge domain to get expertise in two intelligence based skills that your wizard will already be great at. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sorcadin - Paladin X/Sorcerer Y**\n\nThis can be very similar to the above \"Tanky Caster\" where you get defensive features from Paladin, but are primarily a caster. But more commonly people play Sorcadin as a spellsword \"gish\" build. They get up close and smash things over the head, and they use all the extra spell slots they get from full caster levels in sorcerer to do divine smites and deal extra damage. Sorcerer is a popular pick because they get a lot of spell slots (as compared to warlock), and sorcery points to convert into more spell slots. Or they can use metamagic to cast powerful buff spells like haste as a bonus action. I personally feel that with a level 12 cap, it is ideal to start with Paladin 6 to get extra attack and the amazing paladin aura, then go the rest of the levels in sorc. Others may say to go 5 levels paladin and 7 in sorc to get access to 4th level sorc spells. Or may go 7 levels in paladin to get the improved paladin aura from your subclass, and 5 in sorc. You pick what you prefer. Larian gave white draconic bloodline sorc the spell Armor of Agathys as a spell known, so that is the sorc subclass I would pick with known info.\n\n*Edit: I forgot paladins get heavy armor proficiency only if that is your starting class.* Caster focused Sorcadins who are mostly going sorc and only dipping into paladin for tankiness may want to opt for starting with 14 dex, starting as a sorc to get con save proficiency, then take your level(s) in paladin. Though starting as a paladin and putting 13 or 15 in Str and using heavy armor is also valid. But Str based melee Sorcadins should likely start in Paladin, unless you are doing a very niche and nuanced Dex sorcadin build. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Bardadin - Paladin X/Bard Y**\n\nThis is very similar to the Sorcadin above, except bard instead of sorc. You can make a caster heavy focused baradin or a melee focused one, just like the sorcadin. However unlike Sorcadin, the bard has the valor and swords bard subclass. This means a melee focused Bardadin will focus on swords or valor bard for the first 6 levels to get extra attack and then 2 levels in paladin to unlock divine smite, and then the rest can go in bard. But starting as a bard and multiclassing into Paladin means you do not get heavy armor proficiency, so you'll want to be dex based if you go this route.\n\nThis build will do a similar amount of damage as the melee sorcadin since you don't have metamagic to make more spell slots, but you also have more spell slots available and at higher levels due to all your bard levels. Sorcadin probably wins on damage if you are using metamagic to quicken cast buff spells. But Paladin already has a ton of damage potential, and you are supplementing it with your bard spell slots so Bardadin damage is nothing to scoff at whatsoever. However you will be better at out-of-combat support through extra skill proficiencies, jack of all trades, and bardic inspiration than a sorcadin would be. I would play a bardadin over a sorcadin any day thanks to this utility. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lockadin - Paladin X/Warlock Y**\n\nThis is very similar to the Sorcadin above, except warlock instead of sorc. You can make a caster heavy focused lockadin or a melee focused one, just like the sorcadin. The melee focused lockadin takes advantage of getting the warlock's spell slots that come back on a short rest on top of their paladin slots. So they smite away, and then get back two of their spell slots back on a short rest. This multiclass is a lot more common with the warlock's hexblade subclass, but that is not present in BG3. So most that take this build would go paladin 5, then two in warlock, then paladin the rest of the way.\n\n*Edit: But now that Larian is changing Pact of the Blade to use Cha on weapon attack and damage rolls, it becomes tempting to go at least 3 in warlock. And you want to do this right away so that you can start making weapon attacks with Cha. This makes it tempting to go to 5 in warlock so that you can get extra attack. Finding break points on when to multiclass if you want to go this route is complex.* Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Bardlock - Warlock 2/Bard 10**\n\nOne of Bard's greatest down sides is a lack of a good damage source. But they are Charisma casters, warlocks are charisma casters, warlocks get eldritch blast which is a decent damage cantrip, but made into a great damage cantrip with the warlock's agonizing blast invocation at second level. So the build usually goes taking 2 levels in warlock, the rest in bard. \n\n*Edit: But now that Larian is changing Pact of the Blade to use Cha on weapon attack and damage rolls, it becomes tempting to take 5 levels in warlock and then go into bard (likely lore subclass, but you can argue valor or swords) to make a spellsword character.* Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sor-lock-bard-adain**\n\nSome combination of Paladin, Warlock, and the rest in either Bard or Sorc. Using the principles of above four builds. Maybe you make a paladin gish with the benefits of sorc and warlock spell slots. Maybe you make a bard-lock eldritch blast spammer, but dip into paladin for armor and shield proficiency. There are tons and tons of options between the 4 charisma casters. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Ambush Bard - Bard X/Rogue Y**\n\nThis one is actually really simple once you get the hang of it, but a bit complicated to explain without accompanying images. I think the most efficient way to explain this build is with this [short video](https://shattereddisk.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.mp4). Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Ambush Ranger - Assassin Rogue X/Gloomstalker Ranger Y/Fighter Z**\n\nIt is worth noting that Larian has already made several changes to the ranger class. And outside of this build, almost nobody plays the rogue's assassin subclass in tabletop D&amp;D 5e so it may also be adjusted at release. But per tabletop, this build has a devastating opening turn of combat. Especially if it opens from stealth.\n\n1. Gloomstalker gets bonuses that make them very difficult to detect in darkness by most creatures, helping them catch their enemy by \"surprise.\"\n2. Gloomstalker ranger gets to add their Wisdom bonus to their initiative rolls, helping them go early.\n3. Assassin rogue gets advantage on any creature that has not gone yet in combat.\n4. If you started the combat from stealth or otherwise caught the enemy off guard, then any character that is caught unawares during the first round of combat has the \"surprised\" condition. And assassin rogues automatically crit when they hit a surprised target\n5. Gloomstalker rangers get to make one extra attack on the first turn, and if that hits then it does an extra 1d8 damage.\n6. If you are dual wielding or using the crossbow expert feat or polearm master feat then you can make an additional attack using your bonus action.\n7. Action surge, and get three more attacks.\n\nPut all this together and you get 2 attacks from a level 5 ranger or fighter's attack action, another attack doing an additional 1d8 damage from gloom stalker, and a bonus action attack if you are properly equipped with equipment and possibly feats for a total of four attacks. Now add at least 2 levels of fighter to get action surge, which gives you another 3 attacks (2 from extra attack, 1 from gloomstalker opening round which does an additional d8 of damage) attacks for a total of 7 attacks on this absolutely absurd opening turn. One of the above attacks will also do sneak attack damage. Any of these attacks made against targets behind you in initiative will have advantage, and if the target is surprised then each of these attacks automatically crit which doubles the amount of damage dice rolled. And with all these possible crits, half-orc is looking awfully tempting for the extra weapon damage die for each attack that crits.\n\nOnce you get past the first round of combat, this build significantly quiets down. But after such a devastating opening, the enemy is usually down a few members. The exact level split may be up in the air, pending possible changes to assassin rogue and the ranger class. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\nEdit: This build does have a bit of an amusing [\"edgy powergamer reputation\"](https://youtube.com/shorts/ei_1fgIDcgw?feature=share4) in the tabletop community \n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The \"Great\"berry Healer - Life Cleric X/Druid Y or Life Cleric X/Ranger Y**\n\nWhen a healing spell cast by a life cleric does healing, it does an additional 2 points of healing. The goodberry spell in tabletop summons 10 berries, each of which does 1 healing. And in tabletop the life cleric additonal healing does interact with each goodberry consumed. Meaning that a single cast of good berry will do somewhere between 30 hitpoints of healing. But this spell has been changed in BG3 Early Access at least to instead summon four berries, each of which does 1d4 healing (this may change on launch). On its own this change is a roughly equivalent amount of healing. But when BG3's goodberries interact with life cleric's additional healing bonus then this significantly cuts down the expected amount of healing to closer on the order of 29 hp. *Edit: In BG3 Early Access this interaction will also only work if the life cleric who cast the goodberry spell is the one to consume the \"great\"berries, it does not work if another party member eats the \"great\"berries.* It is still extremely powerful for a first level spell, but not as good as in tabletop. All you need is 1 level in life cleric, and the goodberry spell which can be obtained by 1 level in druid or 2 levels in ranger. You can make any of these three classes into your main class after that. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Angry Rogue - Barbarian X/Rogue Y**\n\nFor a rogue to get sneak attack they either need to have advantage on the attack roll, or the target must have another hostile (not counting the rogue) within 5 ft of it while the rogue does not have disadvantage. This is usually achievable, but not always. If only there was some way to just give yourself advantage... This is where two levels in barbarian comes in so you get Reckless Attack. You get advantage on your attack rolls, but enemies will have advantage on attack rolls against you for one round. Fortunately rage and uncanny dodge are there to help your defense a bit. The main way to build this would be to go Strength based, as sneak attack only requires that you use a weapon with the finesse property, but not necessarily that you use dex on your attack rolls. So you can sneak attack by wielding a rapier for example with strength. And while you are at it, apply bonus rage damage if you are raging. If you go this strength route you will probably want to take your first level in barbarian, because that is the only way this build is getting medium armor proficiency (unless you pick the mountain dwarf as your race, or the moderately armored feat). That is how most tabletop players do this build, and I'd recommend doing 2 barb and 10 rogue to catch the bonus ASI/Feat that rogues get at level 10. \n\nBut in BG3 it may be possible to do this with a dex based build. Normally in 5e you do not get the extra barbarian rage damage to your attacks unless you use strength, and you cannot recklessly attack unless you use strength for the attack roll. BG3 Early Access does not impose either of these restrictions, and a Dex based barbarian is a good bit tankier while unarmored than a strength based barbarian is while unarmored. Plus a Dex based barb can start as a rogue and get the extra skill proficiencies that come with this.\n\n*Edit: Furthermore in BG3 you may want to take barbarian to level 3 and pick berserker subclass, and pick the thief subclass for rogue. This will give you two powerful bonus action attacks you can take as a barbarian/rogue multiclass when raging if these subclasses launch the way that they are in Early Access.* Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Classic Eldritch Knight Gish - Eldritch Knight Fighter X/Abjuration Wizard Y**\n\nThe fighter is great because it makes lots of attacks and gets lots of feats. The eldritch knight subclass adds a bit of magic on there. But the magic you can use is severely limited by both spell selection and number of spell slots, since eldritch knight is a 1/3 caster. This is where wizard comes in to shore up the eldritch knight's short comings, by adding more spells known and more spell slots. Abjuration wizard is great, since you'll likely be casting the shield spell a good bit with this build and each time you do you'll get a bit of temp HP thanks to abjuration wizard's Arcane Ward feature. I personally would go EK fighter 7 and abjuration wizard 5. Or EK fighter 8 and abjuration 4 if you prefer an extra ASI/Feat over third level wizard spells. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Skill Monkey Support Bard - Sorc 1/Knowledge Cleric 1/Lore Bard 10**\n\nI meant to add one of these to the post, but am glad I did not because [this commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14ugffa/guide_to_multiclassing_in_bg3_and_some/jr8emoy?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2) provided a better one then the one I was going to do. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Absurd Lightning Damage - Tempest Cleric 2/Storm Sorc 10**\n\nStorm Sorc is typically viewed as one of the weaker subclasses in 5e, and many are hoping to see it buffed in 5e. However Larian has a homebrewed rule in BG3 Early Access that causes lightning damage to do double damage against targets which are \"wet.\" And when a storm sorc casts a leveled spell that does lightning or thunder damage, then you can cause all enemies within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage equal to half of your Sorc level (cantrips don't trigger this effect). So if an enemy is wet (possible via a quicken cast of create water, an ally setting it up by throwing a water flask or other means, etc.) and you cast a lightning leveled spell like chromatic orb, you will do double damage with the lightning spell and damage to all nearby enemies equal to your sorc level. This is potentially very powerful without multiclassing.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Tempest domain clerics get channel divinity at second level allowing them to roll max damage on all the damage on a lightning or thunder spell once a short rest (essentially double damage). So by combining this with storm sorc and the BG3 EA wet condition making enemies vulnerable to lightning damage, this means that once a short rest you can do 4x damage with a lightning spell on a wet enemy, and simultaneously deal damage equal to your sorc level on all enemies near you. And you can use metamagic to do even more damage by enhancing it or twin casting the spell if action economy allows. This is a gimmicky but viable build in tabletop, and if Larian's homebrewed \"wet = double lightning damage\" stays in then it will be even more gimmicky but also more viable in BG3. I recommend first level sorc to get con save proficiency, then two cleric, then the rest sorc. You do not need to have a high Wis for this build, Cha is your main casting stat. Just make sure that the cleric spells you pick are ones that don't require an attack roll or save. Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sorlock - Warlock X/Sorcerer Y**\n\nNote it is almost certain that the once mighty tabletop build referred to as the \"coffeelock\" where you get infinite spell slots will NOT work in BG3. But even ignoring this rulebending build, Sorlocks are still viable. Typically the premise is that sorcs can do great burst damage. Wouldn't it be nice if they can do some extra consistent damage on top of that? So start sorc, take a two level dip in warlock for eldritch blast and agonizing blast, then go sorc the rest of the way. This also gives you some extra warlock pact magic spell slots which come back on a short rest so you can convert into sorcery points to fuel your metamagic shenanigans. Cast a powerful eldritch blast with your action, and follow it up with a quickened fireball with your bonus action or quickened haste to buff your paladin who needs to go charging into combat.\n\n*Edit: But now that Larian is changing Pact of the Blade to use Cha on weapon attack and damage rolls, it becomes tempting to take 5 levels in warlock and then go into sorc to make a spellsword character.* Weigh the opportunity cost.\n\n\n\n# A note on Monk\n\nThe best monk features often rely on Ki points, which you can only get more of by taking more levels in Monk. If you want to multiclass out of monk, most find that the opportunity costs are too high and you would have been better off just staying with monk. Taking a dip into monk grants you melee combat focused features that only work if you are unarmored, so will be useless on most characters. The monk's unarmored defense does not stack or otherwise interact with unarmored defense from a wildshaped druid, or a barbarian's unarmored defense. These reasons are some of the more prominent ones for why monk multiclasses are not common in tabletop. Larian has said they are making changes to monks in BG3. Depending on these changes, monk may become a more tempting multiclass target\n\nI'll link to some comments with monk multiclass ideas from commenters here:\n\n[Spore druid/monk](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14ugffa/guide_to_multiclassing_in_bg3_and_some/jr7rn5s?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2)\n\n[Shadow monnk/battlemaster fighter](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14ugffa/guide_to_multiclassing_in_bg3_and_some/jr7y954?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2)\n\n\n[Shadow monk/thief rogue](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/14ugffa/guide_to_multiclassing_in_bg3_and_some/jr7ya2d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2)\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A note on Thief Rogue\n\nThe thief rogue's Early Access ability to get two bonus actions may be the most power shifting feature in BG3. Many martial characters will get benefit from dual wielding, crossbow expert, or polearm master with a 3 level dip in thief rogue. This is especially the case for ranger, which is notoriously starved for bonus actions. Bonus action controllable spells like spiritual weapon or flaming sphere just got their damage doubled by this. Currently in BG3 early access, Larian does not restrict you from casting a leveled spell with your action and bonus action. This means that a Thief Rogue 3/Fighter 2/Sorc 7 would be able to cast a spell with their action, action surge and get another action to cast a leveled spell, use metamagic to cast a powerful spell as a bonus action, and use metamagic to cast another powerful spell with your extra bonus action. You will burn everything you have to do this, and you will be limited to 4th level spells, so maybe that will balance things. A raging berserker barbarian now gets two very powerful bonus action attacks when they rage, which could go great with the Angry Rogue build. But if thief rogue is going to launch as it is in early access, you should always ask yourself, \"Is 3 levels in thief rogue worth the opprotunity cost.\"\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Changelog\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Newest]\n\n* Edited Sorlock, Bardlock, and Lockadin to relfect Larian making Pact of the Blade allow the use of Cha on attack and damage rolls.\n* Update: Major rule changes section\n* Added Mortismal Gaming [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIzafqErqM) on the subject.\n* Accounted for Bardadin armor proficiency.

However, Early Access has taught me that I'm not really into the Cleric class. I will keep the first cleric level for lore reasons (and some utility), but don't want to progress her base class any further.\n\nSo far, Rogue and Fighter seem good choices and fit the character, but I'd be very interested to read what more crunch oriented players think about multiclassing Shadowheart.\n\nShe will be teamed up with a Barbarian/Sorcerer Dark Urge. Other than that, I'll go with the flow on the other companions.",

One is siding with the dwarves, and the other is siding with the guards(I think?). On a stream the developers talked about how each player could go for a different way of solving the quest. Have they talked about how this will work in BG3?\n\nVery minor spoilers:\n\nIn the recent stream they showed how you can start off act 2 in two different ways/places.

            "selftext": "So I've always been finely in the not multiclassing wizard camp for 5e. I just realized something though. With a level 12 cap, there isn't much downside to doing Wizard 11/something else 1.\n\nFirst off, the main downside of multiclassing wizards, is delayed spell progression. However unless is different from 5e, wizards have the same spell slots at 11 as 12, so no loss there.\n\nYou can still get 6th level spells at level 11. Sure you don't get the 2 free picks at 12, but with scrolls you can still know any/every 6th level wizard spell at 11.\n\nYou miss your last ASI, but I would argue that there are surely some 1 level dips that are worth more than a feat. Could get light armor proficiency with a feat, or medium plus more from 1 level or fighter.\n\nWhat what do you all think the best 1 level dips for wizard will be? Keep in mind full caster spell progression doesn't change from 11 to 12, so any dip should be viable, in theory.\n\nAlternatively, what downside am I missing?\n\nEDIT: Clerics and Druids probably have the same issue, being prepared full casters. Bard and sorcerer would have the same slots but by not taking a 12 level, they miss the chance for more high level spells known.",
